Phase 1 (~30 hours):
	Setup Git Repository and boiler plate
	Build underlying Game Model
		Create classes for all object types
		Create GameManager to control them
	Build basic (code-managed) prototype of game model interactions for testing
	Build XML parser to manage content
	Write up development plan
	
Phase 2 (~30 hours)
	Build some basic UI screens in Unity
	Make UI responsive to the Game Model (have it show the parsed xml data and refer back to the game model for interactions)
	Have basic dialog/department interactions working (no images/visuals yet)
	Connect those interactions to main game screen
	
(Phase 1 and 2 happen simultaneously)
	
Phase 3 (~20 hours)
	Build save-game system
		Probably some kind of XML-based system that duplicates the data from Phase 1?
	Expand Game Model and UI to accomodate all desired features
	Build start-screen for starting/loading a game
	
Phase 4 (~20 hours)
	Work on system for loading image/video content and associating it with UI/Game Model (awwww yeah)
	Build out content for ~3 departments and their associated NPCs
	Work on testing to get this content to a releasable state
	
Phase 5 (~20 hours) - First Beta-Release!
	Polish UI/visuals until it feels "releasable"
	Release first playable BETA of the game!
	Fix any bugs turned up in said version
	
Phase 6 (~20 hours)
	Flesh out content for 5 more departments 
		Teach Selcta how to add content himself?
	Work on win-conditions and overall game objectives
		NOTE: Doing this now will make previous saves icompatable with new version.  Up to you if we wanna delay releasing beta until after this step.
		
Phase 7+
	Continue adding content as desired
