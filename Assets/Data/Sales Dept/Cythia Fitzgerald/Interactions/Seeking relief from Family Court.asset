        It's just so damned unfair!

        than thirty million.  But it turned out Simon was overleveraged everywhere
        and Fitzgerald Capital took a big hit with the Zenith Lions fiasco.  I can't
        even sell the house until Sydney gets her trust fund either!  That tightwad
        Malcolm Geary won't give me a dime more!
