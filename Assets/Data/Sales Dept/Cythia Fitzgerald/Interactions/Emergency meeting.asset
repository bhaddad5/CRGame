      Text: Thanks for the meeting.  I've been thinking about how to respond to Jennifer's
        memo and I have some ideas I wanted to bounce off you.  I think she'll really
        like them and it will assure her that her Director of Sales knows what she's
        doing!

        from the pointless (producing more Artemis branded merchandise for clients)
        to the inane (staging full Chippendale themed receptions for key female and
        gay clients).  You aren''t impressed.'

        the office!
