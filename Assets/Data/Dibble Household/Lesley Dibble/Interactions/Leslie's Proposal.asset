        day at Artemis Marketing, she gets on to Dykon work as soon as she gets home! 
        In some ways, she's as much my wife as my assistant.  But then it has been
        that way since we first met.

        Despite your own considerable charm, she has yet to melt, even a little. 
        That's a challenge to your pride and it niggles you a bit.
