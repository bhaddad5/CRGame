      Text: I was pleased to get your call, Mr. {LastName}.  Welcome to my office. 
        I understand from my wife that you're a rising star at Artemis.  Jayme says
        you've become responsible for a number of activities there.  What's the matter? 
        I'm not what you expected, am I?

      Text: I didn't know what to expect-- only that you designed some of our corporate
        orientation and manager training content.  That's why I'm here.  As I'm given
        more responsibilities in new areas, I'm thinking that training and development
        will be quite important.

      Text: Well, as you see, I'm not some blue haired weirdo.  My brand as The Dykon
        helped me establish my leadership in the LGBTQ community but I am also a
        professional.  It is because I consider diversity and inclusion so critical
        that I present myself accordingly.

      Text: I understand.  Those are obviously core Artemis corporate values.  As
        my portfolio of departments grows, I want to make sure they are instilled
        in all our team members.  Perhaps you could walk me though an overview of
        your services?
