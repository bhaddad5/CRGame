      Text: Well, she asked if she could work for me as part of Dykon actually! 
        I think it might make sense but before I told her yes, I thought  I'd discuss
        it with you.  I mean, the new Artemis contract could more than cover her
        salary.

      Text: As a courtesy, would you mind advising her to remain at Artemis?  With
        Allison gone, I'd hate to lost another pro.  Marketing's been given to me
        until we find a new CMO.  I'd hate to lose her until that's sorted.  Do you
        think you can persuade her to stay?
