  Description: 'OBEIR doesn''t advertise, market itself or even answer unsolicited
    phone calls.  It is a brand steeped in secrecy, known only to a few.  What is
    known to those few is they have a system that guarantees a way of turning the
    most unmotivated employees into the most slavish and productive staffers.  Expensive--
    ridiculously so.  Results- unarguable. '
