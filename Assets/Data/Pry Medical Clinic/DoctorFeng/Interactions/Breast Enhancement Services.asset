        breasts and that's where we can correct where Mother Nature has failed. 
        Whether ir is a simple cup boost or a breast correction procedure, our work
        speaks for itself.

      Text: It is a simple outpatient procedure ensuring minimum downtime.  As for
        the general procedure, there's a charge of ten thousand.  We suggest having
        the patient pay this back over time but, of course, secretaries never have
        the upfront fee and so will need to have the manager finance the work.
