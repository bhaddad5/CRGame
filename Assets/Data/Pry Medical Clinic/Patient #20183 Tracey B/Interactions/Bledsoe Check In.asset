        As she represents a potential threat to herself as well as others, we've
        had to take additional measures.

        generous retainer you've provided to cover her therapy.  It would only be
        natural you'd want to be involved in Tracey's treatment.  With that said,
        I should warn you.

        such cases-- wilful, proud women and girls unwilling to submit to a cure. 
        There will be many uncomfortable visits here before Tracey is close to compliance. 
        Once we have achieved a cure though, I am sure it will have all been worth
        it.   '
