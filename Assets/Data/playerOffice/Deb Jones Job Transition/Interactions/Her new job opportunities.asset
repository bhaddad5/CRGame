      Text: You'll start as a Junior Secretary.  Work hard and you should have no
        problem making the Secretary grade within twelve months.  After that, many
        girls are able to earn their Senior Secretary grade.  This is important because
        each grade carries with it a step increase in your hourly pay rate- isn't
        that exciting?

      Text: Your ultimate ceiling is tied to your boss's seniority.  Once your boss
        reaches the top management band, you could aspire to Personal Assistant status
        and if your boss takes on a C Suite or higher level role, you could even
        earn promotion to the highest secretarial position on the org chart- Executive
        Personal Assistant.  Personally, I see you as having that kind of potential...eventually.
