      Text: Debbie, as you know by now, many of the admin girls look to you as a
        role model.  They seem to look to you for how to dress, how to comport themselves,
        how to interact with their superiors...

      Text: It is also a big responsibility!  We're concerned with the admin girls'
        intellectual stimulation.  I was hoping you could help.  We're thinking of
        setting up a kind of a combo company library and book club.  Would you mind
        reviewing this book for me-- let me know if it is appropriate for our admin
        staffers?
