      Text: Her new reading list!  I told her it was part of her therapy and would
        help remind her of how different she actually is-- that each silly romance
        novel would help reinforce her own self-identification as an excutive that's
        simply in a down phase.  I think I called it Transference Therapy or something
        just as silly.

        triggers instead make the fiction validate her own reality and she identifies
