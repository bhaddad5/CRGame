      Text: Debbie, I haven't seen you post anything regarding your new position
        on your various social media accounts.  I also note that you have yet to
        invite me to follow you on any of your accounts.  I assume it is just something
        you overlooked and you'll take care of both of these lapses.

        feel that the change in jobs was something I really wanted to bring any attention
        to-- to be honest.

        to want to share the happy news, I'm not sure what to say.  Perhaps I misjudged
        the situation.  I thought you were grateful for the chance to continue to
        work here.  If that's not the case, we can always make other arrangements--

        I really should update my profiles to include my new position.
