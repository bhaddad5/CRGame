      Text: I do.  I worked it out.  I'll be making ten percent less now but that's
        a whole lot better than thirty percent!  I'm just not going to be able to
        go on any vacatiosn any time soon.  I wanted to thank you by the way. Mr.
        {LastName}.  For just going with a C cup.

      Text: You are quite welcome but your preferences didn't affect my decision. 
        I believe that "just enough" is a much more confiident statement than a messy
        excess.  A personal secretary with 34 Cs sends the right message- I'm powerful
        enough to have what I want but not prone to juvenile desires.  Don't you
        agree?

        hateful payroll penalty.  She has nothing to fear as you evalaute and approve
        her new status with Payroll.  Her brand new artificially symetrical and ripe
        34 C cups pass muster easily!
