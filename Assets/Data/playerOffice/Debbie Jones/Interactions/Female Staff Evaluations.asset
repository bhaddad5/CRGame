        What's the project?

      Text: Calm down, Debbie.  You have nothing to worry about.  But once the departmental
        lists are made up, I will expect you to get close to the girls and provide
        a detailed profile of each-- say no less than a thousand words on each girl.

      Text: Exactly, Debbie.  Give me an MBA style analysis of each girl, including
        numerical ratings of all the girl's physical features- face, tits, ass, legs--
        you get the picture.  You may use yourself as a baseline seven as a point
        of comparison.  How's that sound like for a project?  Are you going to be
        a good little spy for me?
