      Text: OK, you check out.  And if you're talking to me, you want someone hacked. 
        I can do it BUT I'll need $100 upfront and every time you want to take a
        peek in, it will be another $500.  Plus you need to give me a name and an
        address.  For that, I can give you eyes on your prize.  You'll be able to
        watch the subject on webcam whenever you like.
