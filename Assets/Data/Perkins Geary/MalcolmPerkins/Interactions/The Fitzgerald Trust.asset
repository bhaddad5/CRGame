        unpleasant and rather common woman, I have to say.  Yes, Simon set it up
        with us.  We did quite a lot with Simon when he was alive.  We were the M&A
        firm for his Zenith Lions acquisition.

      Text: Well, since he's dead now, I'm free to tell it like it is.  Simon was
        keen to micro manage in the franchise but the existing management kept him
        at bay.  That's when he told me he thought the color of the head office needed
        to change.  That's him, not me.  I warned him but he was determined to break
        the franchise like some wild horse.

      Text: It broke Simon instead.  After a massive backlash, the league forced
        him to sell the Lions.  Fitzgerald Capital was left a shadow of its former
        glory.  Frankly, Simon got what he deserved, God rest his soul.

        would revert to Perkins Geary until a suitable replacement coudl be named. '

        How such funds woul dbe invested and how they might grow or diminish only
        time could tell.  But this is all subject to the review and approval of the
        Family Court.

        MacAllister's office has enormous sway over Family Court adjudication.  You
        might want to continue this conversation with him.  Between the three of
        us, we might find a better use for that thirty million.  I'm assuming a third
        each, should we proceed?
