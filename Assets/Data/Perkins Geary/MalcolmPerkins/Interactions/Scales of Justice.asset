      Text: Of course I did.  When I told her she'd be getting the Artemis job, I
        had her on video.  She was so triumphant, she didn't deny it when I accused
        her of blackmail.  It is here-- on this drive.  To be honest, I was done
        with her and confronting her wouldn't have made me look good.  I was happy
        to b edone with Amber and the whole mess.  So now you know the whole story.
