      Text: I've spoken with Jackson.  He's interested in taking over as Artemis
        Corpotrate Counsel-- and he'll expect the opportunity to get in on any IPO.

      Text: Naturally.  As Corporate Counsel, he'd be entitled to participate.  Are
        we sure Jennifer would appoint him?

      Text: She'd follow my guidance.  She loves having a Big Law shop like us representing
        the brand.  Once Amber is returned here for a new role, Jackson will be in
        like Flynn.  There's one remaining item to cover off though.

      Text: I want Jackson to start his career in the family tradtion.  He'll need
        a mistress.  Something disposable in th elong term and in a secretarial role
        for convenience.  A pliable girl there to see to his needs.

      Text: Valerie Lyon!  She'd be perfect!  She's a trained paralegal already in
        teh department.  She's going to law school at night but...

      Text: 'Send along some photos for Jackson, but I''m sure she''ll do.  All you
        need to do now is have someone research the Artemis legal archives and find
        Amber''s biggest fuck-up.  It will be there-- I know Amber!  I''ll begin
        setting things up on my end.  Priming the paralegal for her new boss would
        be helpful as well.  '
