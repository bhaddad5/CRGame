        own Perkins Geary office is the black bishop.  After our last chat, it seemed
        an appropriate offering.

      Text: 'Insightful as well!  You are correct.  Though I''d deny it under oath,
        yes-- of course that''s why I took her on.  She wasn''t good enough to work
        here otherwise.  But she began to resent the none too subtle innuendos around
        the office and she turned on me.  It was blackmail, pure and simple.  '

        much needed credibility.  I suggested Jen take on Amber as Artemis Corporate
        Counsel.  Quid pro quo. '
