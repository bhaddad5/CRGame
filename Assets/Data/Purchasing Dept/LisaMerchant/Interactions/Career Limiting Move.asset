      Text: 'NOTE:  After being put on the defensive by your attack on her performance,
        Lisa counter attacks with claims that your interference in Purchasing Department
        operations has caused problems.  Her efforts fail and become a career limiting
        move when you double down.  Having failed, it looks increasingly likely that,
        should you make a move, Purchasing will soon fall under your authority.  '
