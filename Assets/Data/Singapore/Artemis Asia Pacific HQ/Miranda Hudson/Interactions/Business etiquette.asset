      Text: 'Miranda, I''ve noticed you assume a troubling familiarity towards your
        boss.  In Singapore business etiquette, it is considered unseemly for a female
        subordinate to assume such familiarity.  If Artemis is to be considered a
        respectable operator, such familiarity has to end. '
