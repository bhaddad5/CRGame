      Text: David, I think the acquisition and training of Miranda has really raised
        your reputation as a Man of the World.  I suspect many of your colleagues
        are incredibly jealous!

      Text: You're not wrong,  {FirstName}!  I think my appointment as Managing Director
        of Artemis Asia Pac has impresssed many in my social circles, but having
        Miranda to show off as my Personal Assistant has many looking at me in an
        tirely different light.  It's... quite nice.

      Text: May I make a suggestion?  Have Miranda advertise the nature of her new
        role.  A very naughty selfie does wonders to cement her repuation as your
        office pet.  Keep yourself obscured but make her exposure as explicit as
        you like.
