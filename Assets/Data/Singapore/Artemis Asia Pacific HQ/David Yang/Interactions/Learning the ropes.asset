        hand with her.  Tie her up and give it to her a bit hard, when she needs
        it.  Mrs. Yang thinks these Western sluts deserve whatever they get, but
        I do feel a little guilty from time to time-- even though it is fun. '

      Text: David, put it out of your head, my friend.  You're simply enjoying a
        perk of the job.  Miranda's there to provide pleasure and serve.  Mrs. Yang
        is right-- these Western girls, especially spoiled blondes, sometimes need
        some strong medicine.  I can attest to that from personal experience!
