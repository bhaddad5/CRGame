        wife has been chiding me as not being assertive with Miranda.  When you...
        om... did this with your own secretary, how did she react?'

      Text: Don't be nervous, David.  Your wife is exactly right-- just take charge. 
        Miranda's just a Western slut-- she's probably been anxious for you to take
        control.  As the PA to a powerful Singaporean man, she knows she has no choice
        but to serve you in whatever way you desire.  There's no problem- she can't
        get pregnant.
