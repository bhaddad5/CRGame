        for your unplanned leaving from PriceMillhouseKoopers.  It is just all so
        unfortunate.  But let's move forward in a positive direction, shall we? 
        One door closes and another opens, right Matty?

        me that.  No, I don't blame you.  The Amberleys were behind it, I'm sure
        of it.  They used their resources to besmirch my reputation.  And while we
        did have an affair, I never stopped being loyal, at least in my heart, to
        Rupert.
