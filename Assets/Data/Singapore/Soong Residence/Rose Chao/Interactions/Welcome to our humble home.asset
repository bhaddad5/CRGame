      Text: David felt a bit uncomfortable to be involved in this little chat.  You
        see, I sort of pushed him to arrange this.  But I am a practical woman and
        I was aware that a favor was owed.  I'm not shy about claiming what I want.

        phenomenal.  I owe him for that-- and if he's transferred the favor to you,
        then it is yours to claim, Ms. Chao.

      Text: It is Rose please-- just Rose.  I'm no longer in the public eye.  It
        is difficult for Western women in Hollywood to land decent roles once one
        is my age-- and for Asian women, virtually impossible.  I should have been
        a much bigger success in Hollywood than I was.  It is an industry that has
        not been kind to Asian talent like me.

      Text: Because in Hollywood, even I came under the spell of paler beauty.  I
        was so envious of those cool blue eyed, blonde beauties I ended up losing
        roles to.  It became a quiet obsession of mine.  Now I'm retired and very
        happy as David Soong's domestic partner, but...  On another topic, my, what
        a change for that Australian girl!

        means.  You're a busy man-- you won't be spending all your time in Singapore
        now, will you?  if that's the case, I wanted to suggest a sharing arrangement
        with you... regarding Matilda Campbell.  She's no movie star, but she is
        pretty enough.  And she's discreet?

        to share my bed with David.  Keeping her for myself is another matter entirely.

        I have to.  But sharing Matty with another woman?  I'd have no objections. 
        I don't believe she is a lesbian or even bisexual--
