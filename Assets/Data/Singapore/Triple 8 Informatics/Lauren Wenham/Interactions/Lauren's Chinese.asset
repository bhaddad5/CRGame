      Text: Thanks, Mr. {LastName}!  I'm not sure what that means but Mr. Soong said
        he'd train me.  He said it was more like being an office helper than making
        tea, though I'll be in charge of getting tea for the office-- or coffee or
        whatever.  He said I needed to learn some Chinese though and that you could
        help me with that?

        basic words and phrases but you're a smart girl and a fast learner.  Have
        you spoken with your mother about all this?

        She wasn't happy but there's not much she can do about it.  Hey, I'm eighteen
        years old-- right?  I'm not going back to Christchurch and that horrible
        farm!
