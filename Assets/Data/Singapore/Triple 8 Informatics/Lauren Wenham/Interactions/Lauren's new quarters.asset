      Text: Yes, Mr. {LastName}!  Mr. Soong said Ms. Rose thought it would be best
        if I moved in with them!  They have a small room next to the laundry.  It
        should be fine for me-- better than that place-- Geyling?  They thought that
        might be too, uh, inconvenient.  Plus I can help Ms. Rose.  She's so beautiful! 
        I loved her movies!
