      Text: If you insist.  What an annoying woman.  My dear Rose has a soft spot
        for the bitch which I find quite unfathomable.  She's so rude.  I think she
        thinks if she fights me all the time that this is the way to do business. 
        Quite crude and graceless.  I have NEVER cheated her clients!

      Text: Of course you haven't.  I'm quite sure your analysis is quite correct. 
        She tries to compensate for being a woman in business by being aggressive. 
        It's most ungracious.  With that said, might I ask you for a favor-- one
        I'd be happy to return-- and respond more positively towards her?  For example,
        could you compliment her when she tries to speak Chinese with you?

        know Campbell talks about her upcoming wedding incessantly.  I can't imagine
        she'd be content to throw it all away to become a secretary in Singapore!
