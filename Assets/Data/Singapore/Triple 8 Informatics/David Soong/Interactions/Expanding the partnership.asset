      Text: David, it is obvious that Artemis needs to do more to support Triple
        8, but I do hope our commitment is taken as sincere.  We've addressed the
        marketing gap.  How else can Artemis help grow our business in Asia Pac?

      Text: 'You''ve certainly shown us you''re serious about supporting us-- the
        marketing investment is generous, {FirstName}.  I do think there are opportunities
        here, especially based on some of the rumors regarding your next generation
        offerings.  The few anonymous items that have dropped on your AGATHA program
        are intriguing. '

      Text: You've heard about AGATHA?  Hmmm.  Well, when those products are ready
        for market, we'll be happy to share more details.  That said, AGATHA is designed
        for a very niche market and is still in the research stage.

      Text: Well, since you ask-- nothing shows commitment to a market than a physical
        presence.  Singapore respects that kind of commitment.  A physical address
        with a respected local director-- preferably at a prestigious address-- would
        go far in boosting your profile here.
