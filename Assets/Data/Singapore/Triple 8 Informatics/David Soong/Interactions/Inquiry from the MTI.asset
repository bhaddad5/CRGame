      Text: It could be either, but being on their radar is inevitable once a firm
        reaches a certain threshold of commercial success.  It means you're important
        enough to take notice of.  MTI is our Ministry of Technology and Innovation. 
        Many consider it to be the most important governmental authority in all of
        Singapore.

        and will no doubt reach out to David Yang sooner of later.  They seem quite
