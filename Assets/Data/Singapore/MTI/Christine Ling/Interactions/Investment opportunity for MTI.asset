      Text: An appointment well earned, Director Ling!  My congratulations!  This
        makes my visit perhaps of even more interest.  You see, I'm seeking to form
        a consortium of backers for a planned acquisition.  I know that MTI has occasionally
        considered such investment opportunities, especially if they are in the tech
        sector.

        Prometheus is unknown to me but that's irrelevant.  Under you, Artemis seems
        to have made the right moves.  We might be open to providing a Line of Credit--

        Technology and Business Advisor to MTI?  His reputation is sterling and I
        have no doubt his guidance would be hugely valued!  We'd take care of his
        travel and expenses, as well as a generous per diem.  And we'd only need
        him for four or five annual meetings...
