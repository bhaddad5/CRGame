      Text: Mr. {LastName}, I understand Artemis Asia Pacific is expanding and that
        you require additional visas for new staff.  Please understand that you are
        required to fill all executive positions with Singaporeans, unless none are
        available after a lengthy recruitment campaign.

      Text: Yes, Officer Ling.  I intend to fill all such positions with Singaporeans. 
        However, I do have need of administrative staff.  Such positions are so menial
        that I can't imagine any Singaporean lady being interested in applying. 
        I also wish to provide the Singaporean executives with such admin girls to
        support them.

        well trained Western girls. '

        visa which would allow for the importation of such talent for local market
        requirements.  Perhaps a visa with more restrictive and explicit limitations
        might be in order.  I''m also aware of Singapore''s commitment to public
        health.  Might I make an additional suggestion? '

        such a visa would require of them.  That would be left to the Western imports
        exclusively I think.
