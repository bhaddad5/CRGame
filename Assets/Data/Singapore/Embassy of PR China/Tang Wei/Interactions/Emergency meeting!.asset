      Text: ...genuine.  The death of the CIA agent was a waste and unnecessary. 
        The Chinese have learned a hard lesson.  When dealing with Selectacorp, you
        never deviate from the original agreement without major consequences!  You
        now have major leverage with the Chinese should you choose to deal with them
        ever again.
