        when everyone else urged me to just get a job working for someone else! 
        It is good to meet you.  I looking forward to discussing a transaction.

      Text: I understand you were able to 'place' the little Kiwi girl with David. 
        What a delight!  And so respectful and obedient!  I didn't think Western
        girls were capable of such polite behavior!  Of course I immediately began
        to want one of my own.  As a bit of an upstart, possessing a sexy Western
        girl would be quite a symbol of success!

      Text: It is a two part process.  You'd provide me with a recording of your
        voice.  Once the technology is introduced to the subject's system, it then
        tunes the female to respond to your voice's tonal patterns with an involuntary
        desire to submit.  Your voice, Mr. Tang, will be as the Voice of God to the
        woman in question.  She may try to resist but eventually she'll bend to your
        will.

      Text: We use the subject's own memories to define new life boundaries. We refer
        to it as the Mnemosyne subroutine part of our operating system.  False memories
        are crafted and inserted into real memories.  The two merge and provide a
        way for the subject to reinterpret their reality accordingly.  It is a very
        delicate process and we are in early stages of deployment.
