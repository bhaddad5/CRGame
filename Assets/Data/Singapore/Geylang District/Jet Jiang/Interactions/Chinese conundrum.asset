      Text: I found her.  Dominque Howard turned it inide out.  She strongly implied
        it was my patriotic duty to help discover and push information on to her. 
        She dressed it up but she basiclly wants an informer.  Has Mr. Kempler com
        back with instructions?

      Text: Yes.  "China memorandum of understanding is a priority"-- there it is. 
        But he also warned about any technology transfer.  He wants to remind you
        that China is an expert at reverse engineering out anything they get their
        hands on.  Unless you want a competitor churning our AGATHA chips st cost,
        you'll need to figure that part out.

      Text: That's the easy part.  AGATHA implants can't be removed.  Any attempt
        to do so results in the disintegration of th eimplant.  It would be like
        trying to crack open a snow globe for what's inside it.  No, that won't be
        the problem.  It will be figuring out how to get a CIA agent to ingest an
        implant AND aurally imprint her with Wei's voice.  I think I know how to
        do it, but I better speak with Tang Wei first.
