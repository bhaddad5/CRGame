      Text: I'd remind you I'm only here because an invitation to the Tower Club-
        especially for a Western woman- is as rare as hen's teeth.  Of course, I
        wanted to dress for the occasion.  Rupert will be hearing ALL about this
        meeting.  I don't believe he's ever been invited here!

        should tell him about our meeting here.  If I were your fianc\xE9, I'd certainly

      Text: You can be sure I will.  His family has been so paranoid about our marriage
        plans, I've found the only way to shake him of their suspicions is to be
        completely transparent with him.  There are no secrets between us- none at
        all.

        the Old Money family and the smart, striving princess.  It sounds like you
        deserve each other.  Cheers.
