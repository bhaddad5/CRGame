        of hand to even show her the AGATHA chip I pretended to remove.

      Text: Yes, but I've put AGATHA in monitor mode for now.  You'll continue to
        get alerts but the verbal guidance will be replaced with more nuanced micro-bursts
        of chemicals designed to elevate or depress mood, as needed.  You'll also
        find she'll be much more receptive to any demands she's previously refused.
