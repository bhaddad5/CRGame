        resistance, Agatha can't hurt or harm her.  It is only the threat of communicating
        non-compliance to you that has any punitive value.

        her remotely to meet all your expectations, whatever they may be.  If you
        allow Debbie to disobey her new tutor, this is all just a waste of time.
