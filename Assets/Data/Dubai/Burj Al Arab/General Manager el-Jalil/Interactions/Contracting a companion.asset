      Text: Miss el-Jalil, you mentioned contracting a companion, if I were to be
        visiting Dubai on a regular basis.  I think I might be and I was wondering
        if you might share more information about that.

      Text: I see.  Yes, well, it is understood that our guests may wish for company. 
        In recent years, Dubai has become a destination for certain types of Western
        girls whose careers have stumbled.  Recently, with the economic uncertainty
        in the West and the rise of the Middle East, this trickle has turned into
        a bit of a stream.

      Text: Entertainment- movies, television and the like.  It seems that it is
        a resource that the West is now exporting, much to the delight of our regional
        notables.  The half life of these poor girls grows shorter all the time. 
        Luckily, they can find new opportunities here in the Gulf in, well- let us
        call it the hospitality field.

        here, but you''ll find them all over Dubai.  I have currently a redhead available,
        if you''d like to interview her.  I can schedule for her to come in.  I know
        she''s quite eager for a Companion Contract. '

      Text: Very well.  I'll have Sophie present herself here in the lobby shortly. 
        If she pleases you and you agree on a price, she'll be allowed to stay with
        you in your suite and be available to you whenever you're here in Dubai. 
        And when you're not here, she'll be stationed in the lobby to await your
        arrival.
