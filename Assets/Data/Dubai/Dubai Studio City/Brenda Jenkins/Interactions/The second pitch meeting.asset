        Sorry for the inconvenience it may have caused.  Did it all go... well?

      Text: Just fine, just fine!  Look, I want to get this script issue cleared
        up.  These scripts are silly and frankly exploitative!  They don't portray
        my daughter in a serious light at all-- they seem to be the fever dreams
        of some demented fan, to be honest!  Who's the writer anyway?

      Text: I've been thinking about your concerns regarding the proposed scripts. 
        You think they may not up to the standards an aspiring star like Jo Beth
        deserves.  That they may portray her in less than a flattering light.  But,
        let's be honest- Jo Beth is nothing special, is she Brenda?  I mean she was
        a bit player on a fifth rate reality tv series and now she's a generic teen
        influencer.

        be honest here, Brenda.  My assessment of Jo Beth's potential is accurate...
