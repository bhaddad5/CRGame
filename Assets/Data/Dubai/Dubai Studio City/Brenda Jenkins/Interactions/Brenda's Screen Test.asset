      Text: Mitzi mentioned Jo Beth is really eighteen-- which is great.  Since she
        claims publiclly that she's only sixteen, it creates a great... very legal...
        way to have her dip into more... adult roles.

      Text: No.  I don't think so.  She's a pretty face and is young, but as far
        as talent?  I'm afaraid she's going to have to rely on her more obvious assets
        if she's to become a breakout star.  But let's discuss that later.  I think
        it is time you got your own screen test, Brenda.  Why don't you get undressed
        and show Mr. {LastName} and myself why you should be cast in a Studio City
        production?
