      Text: With respect, Sheikh, she's quite a bit older than Zayed!  She thinks
        of him more as a little brother!  Now, as for these scripts-- they all seem
        so... disappointing.  Juvenile.  Jo Beth needs a dramattic role, something
        that will showcase her acting chops-- a role that shows she's not some reality
        tv star du jour!  These scripts just don't cut it!

      Text: Ms. Jenkins, I agree with you.  If we're to be honest Sheikh, Jo Beth
        Jenkins is a star in the making- a diamond in the rough.  These roles are
        all off brand.  Super hero, sitcom sweetheart, romantic interest- these are
        all exploitative.  Can't we do better?

        In the meantime, my admin staff tell me we need a medical exam for insurance
        purposes.  Liability or soemthing or other-- will that be alright, Ms. Jenkins?
