        Beth.  It's a bit of a take-off on Big Bang Theory.  Are you familiar with

        was very pretty!  He had quite a few idea that are reflected in the pilot

      Text: It seems she's quite insistent, Sheikh.  I'm sorry but there it is. 
        Might I suggest something to get this project back on track?   Let's toss
        this script-- it obviously isn't appropriate-- and we go with something more
        serious.  How does that sound, Jo Beth?  Brenda?

      Text: Well, maybe there was a misunderstanding...I guess.  I was thinking of
        something more classic like The Tinder Box or Princess Alicia or The Lady
        in Blue than some dumb sitcom pilot!

      Text: Quite right!  Brenda- take Jo Beth back to the hotel while the Sheikh
        and I discuss this matter.  I'm so sure we'll find the right script that
        I'm asking you to even go ahead and sschedule your studio medical with Dr.
        Quadir- the one your mother's already seen to.  Is that ok?
