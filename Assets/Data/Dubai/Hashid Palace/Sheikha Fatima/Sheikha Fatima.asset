  Bio: The Sheikh's wife is a former Lebanese soap opera actress, hugely popular
    across the Middle East.  Though she'd once hoped to make the hop to Hollywood,
    Fatima pragmatically accepted the wedding proposal from Hashid instead.  It is
    her bitterness at having been shunned by Western casting directors that may have
    given birth to her new personal focus.
