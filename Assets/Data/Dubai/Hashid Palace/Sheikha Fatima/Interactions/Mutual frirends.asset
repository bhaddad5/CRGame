        and the Zubaids have always been close.

      Text: I'm from Beirut and when I came to Dubai, it was Haziqa who introduced
        me to her circle.  We've been close ever since.  You'd think Arab women are
        supposed to be bundled away like chattel, if you were to just listen to silly
        troublemakers like Yasmine!  But  actually, it is the women who are a far
        more interesting lot, I'd say!

      Text: Certainly my wife is more interesting than me, Mr. {LastName}!  I'm afraid
        I had to steal her away from the celebrity she enjoyed as a media star in
        Lebanon-- but I am a most selfish man!  But based on Haziqa's past time,
        I think you'd agree that our ladies have most unusual hobbies and wide ranging
        interests, do they not, Mr. {LastName}?

      Text: Isn't it fun?  Haziqa wrangles her stock with such skill it is a pleasure
        to watch!  We have our own little getaway as well.  Unlike the Zubaid ranch,
        ours is a more commercial venture.
