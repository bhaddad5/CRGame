      Text: I think I'll be ordering more of these South American girls!  They are
        fairly inexpensive and what spirit they have!  Brio, they call it!  These
        two little tigresses put on quite a show, I promise  you!  You'll need to
        lodge a wager of $200,000 on this contest.

      Text: One is the wife of an executed opposition leader, while the other is
        a telenovela actress who was the mistress of a now deposed dictator.  They
        were both considered dispensable enough to ship to the Stable, where the
        Sheikha snapped up what she considered to be a couple of bargains!
