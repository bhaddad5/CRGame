        Russian enemy remains as incandescent in the arena as it did on the battlefield! 
        Even the Russian seems intimidated and when the Ukraininan makes her move,
        she seems to crumple immediately!  It is a disappointingly brief combat.

        The Russian, however, seems unimpressed and when the Ukraininan makes her
        move, the Russian knocks her back easily!  It is a disappointingly brief
        combat.
