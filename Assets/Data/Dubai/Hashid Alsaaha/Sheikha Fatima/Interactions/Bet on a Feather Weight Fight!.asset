      Text: Feather Weight battles feature girls with some grit!  To qualify for
        Feather Weight, they need to have at least six wins.  The rewards are worth
        it- they no longer share a bunk, they are fed twice daily and groomed weekly. 
        Feather Weights have to fight to hold on to their place, but are also generally
        eager to move up into Bantam.

      Text: Battles are evenly matched to reflect 50/50 odds.  Feather Weight wagers
        are set at $300,000.  The focus is less on the stick than the carrot.  Feather
        Weight fight winners are rewarded with their pick of a companion from the
        Fly Weights, while losers are merely subjected to the loss of a meal and
        a light cropping.
