      Text: 'I was so happy to get my hands on an actual US female fighter pilot! 
        Had to pay through the nose for her, but it was worth it!  So few are rarely
        shot down!  The Canadian girl fighter was thankfully much less expensive
        to purchase.  It should prove a nice match, a battle of brains and brawn,
        right?  '

      Text: ...to fight, but that only alsts so long.  The lash always 'persuades'
        a girl to fully participate.  Once they've tasted the whip, they fight well
        enough!  And these two have given us some real edge of seat bouts!  You'll
        need to lodge a wager of $500,000 on this contest.
