      Text: These two really despise each other!  They were both acquired around
        the same time and they've already been disciplined twice for fighting in
        the slave quarters.  It seems the animosity goes deep-- some kind of natural
        feral bitchiness we love to encourage.  You'll need to lodge a wager of $200,000
        on this contest.

      Text: ...reveal that both girls enjoyed some level of fame in their respective
        home lands and both were used to be treated as spoiled divas, before being
        added to the stable, of course.  For such heated rivals, they could be sisters
        as they look so similiar!
