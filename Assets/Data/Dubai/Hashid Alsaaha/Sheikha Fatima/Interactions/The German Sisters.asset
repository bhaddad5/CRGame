      Text: These two were part of a Lutheran charity mission to Somalia.  Laudable! 
        They were easily separated from the main group and the guerilla leader knew
        well enough to call me before they were abused too much!  How could I refuse
        such an offer?  Aren't they adorable?

      Text: ...is always rather tiresome and the trainers have little patience for
        it.  These two put up a fight, begged, pleaded-- even attempted to negotiate-
        can you believe it?  But after enough time on the block, they decided breaking
        taboos was preferable to enduring more pain.  I'm so pleased with the way
        they turned out!
