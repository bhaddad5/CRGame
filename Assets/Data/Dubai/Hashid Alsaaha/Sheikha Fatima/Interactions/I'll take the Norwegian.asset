      Text: ...more careful and calculating than the more peripatetic Swede.  She
        waits for the other Scandanavian's bouncing and bobbing to pause, then makes
        her move.  With a tackle, she leaves the Swede gasping and dazed.  After
        climbing atop her, the Norwegian forces her submission and takes the win
        with quiet dignity.  The crack of the crop sounds makes the Swede sing in
        a different key!

        waits for the other Scandanavian's bouncing and bobbing to pause, then makes
        her move.  Alas, the Swede anticipates and sidesteps.  The aid worker falls
        hard and the Swede is immediately on her, grinding herself mercilessly until
        the Norwegian sullenly submits.  The Swede has won and the Norwegian is cropped
        hard.
