      Text: 'This match pits grace against brute force.  The German was in excellent
        shape when I bought her- a real rising star on Germany''s World Cup Women''s
        soccer team!  She''s also a hardcore lesbian, as many of them are.  The Pole
        is a strapping police officer, as well as a faithful Catholic.  The two really
        do not get along! '
