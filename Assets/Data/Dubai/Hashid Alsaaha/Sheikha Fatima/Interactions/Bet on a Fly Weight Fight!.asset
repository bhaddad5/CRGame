      Text: Fly Weight contests involve girls who have survived their initial induction
        into the stable.  They still often harbor hopes of eventual escape but are
        more concerned with the challenges of day to day survival.  Fly Weights fight
        hard, if without much polish.  For many, they provide the best entertainment
        value the arena has to offer.

      Text: 'Battles are evenly matched to reflect 50/50 odds.  Fly Weight wagers
        are set at $200,000.  Regional rivalries are encouraged, and national anthems
        are often played to motivate the girls.  Both rewards and penalties increase
        in the Fly Weight competitions to really encourage the fighters to give their
        best.      '
