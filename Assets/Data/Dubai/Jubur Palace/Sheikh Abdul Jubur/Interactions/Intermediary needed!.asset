        an intermediary and I thought of my favorite American these days.  You see,
        I need to reach an understanding with your nation's official representatives. 
        Ambassador Peabody in particular.  I don't want to relive this Yasmine nightmare
        again, you see.  When I asked for their help, I totally was ignored!

        well, his wife Zuri actually.  Your State Department has been attempting
        to undermine our local traditions and customs for years now and this Zuri
        managed to become Yasmine''s friend and get in her ear.  The next thing I
        knew-- well, you KNOW what happened!  And I''m not having this happen again!   '

        of pressure on me from my neighbors.  They have committed to support me because
        they don't want the US disrupting their societies either!  This blatant interference
        in our affairs has formalized an alliance of Arab states-- and they've asked
        me to become a public face for this new group.

      Text: You have profile now- you're a CEO with a global profile.  They'll have
        to take you seriously.  Go to Ambassador Peabody and ask him politely, on
        my behalf, for his personal promise to refrain from pushing these progressive
        positions in Dubai and elsewhere in the Middle East.  He needs to keep his
        wife from doing so as well.  Zuri Peabody has phoned repeatedly for Yasmine-
        it must stop!
