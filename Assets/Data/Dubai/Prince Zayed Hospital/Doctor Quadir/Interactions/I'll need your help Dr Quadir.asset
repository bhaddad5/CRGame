      Text: A miracle born from tragedy, Mr. {LastName}.  I was the ob gyn doctor
        on duty at the General Dubai Medical Center when the Princess al-Kather passed
        and the Prince was born.  The Sheikh established this institution that day. 
        I'm proud to  say this is one of the finest hospitals in the world and the
        finest in the Middle East.
