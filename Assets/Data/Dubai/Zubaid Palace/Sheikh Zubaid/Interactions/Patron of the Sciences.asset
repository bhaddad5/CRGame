        My pilot says your airport is the best in the world and I''m sure Dubai leads
        in many areas.  It was a delightful surprise to receive your invitation.

        fellow citizens seem to lose theirs, especially when judging our local customs
        and culture.  I was must pleased, as were all the sheikhs, to hear of Princess
        Yasmine's safe return to Dubai.  You were involved, I understand?

        inquiry- one that deserves more notice and emulation!  From Al-Haitham to
        Al-Razi to Al-Khwarizmi and beyond, Muslim thinkers have shed much light
        on the mysteries of Nature!  Medicine, astronomy and mathematics all owe
        their foundations to such men!
