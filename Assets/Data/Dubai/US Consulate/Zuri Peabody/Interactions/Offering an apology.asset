      Text: Mrs. Peabody, I was hoping you'd see me.  I just wanted you-- and the
        Ambassador, of course!-- to know I gave your answer to Sheikh Jubur.  He
        wasn't happy but... well, you don't cross the US, right?  He said he'd reconsider
        existing policies regarding women's rights and that he was hoping to speak
        with you to get your ideas about it.

      Text: 'I''m sure he''d love your input as well, but he felt that working with
        Mrs. Peabody might make more sense to start with, given how passionate she
        is about women''s rights.  Mrs. Peabody, I hope you understand I was only
        doing as the Sheikh asked.  I''m a huge supporter of empowering women- it
        is what Artemis is all about!  Will you accept my apology?  '

      Text: Marty, hush!  This is the way you have to handle bullies like this! 
        The little sheikh has no choice-- he doesn't want to cross the American ambassador,
        does he?  Go on, Mr. {LastName}-- now you can be OUR messenger boy.  Persuade
        your Arab friend to do the right thing so we can put this unpleasantness
        behind us.  I'm eager to get busy drafting a whole new civil code for this
        backward country!
