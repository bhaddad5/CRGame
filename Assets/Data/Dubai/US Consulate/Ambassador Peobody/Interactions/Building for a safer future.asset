        fine taste in exotics like Zuri here.  Now, to business!  My advisor and
        I are here to discuss building on the Accords.  Given your little plot to
        turn our city into a military base, it is clear we need to develop our own
        defence.

        of influence and no US forces are permitted within it without our express
        permission.  You must be getting quite frustrated-- it has been some time
