      Text: Of course, Mr. {LastName}!  I'll admit I'd didn't know much until I mentioned
        your meeting request to my wife.  Then Zuri proceeded to school me all about
        how important Artemis Technology is and how your technology champions women. 
        So, of course after all that, I was happy to take the meeting.  How may I
        be of service?  Are you looking to grow Artemis here in the region?

      Text: 'It actually has nothing to do with my company, Ambassador.  I''m here
        at the request of Sheikh Jubur.  I''m honored to have his trust, so he asked
        me to speak with you in an unofficial capacity.  He''d like some assurances
        that the incident involving Princess Yasmine won''t happen again in the future. 
        He thought a back channel approach might be the best way to settle all this. '

      Text: Oh.  I see.  Well, I appreciate the Sheikh's position.  I can tell you
        there was no intention to embarrass him, but Princess Yasmine is her own
        woman-- and we very much share her concerns regarding the status and rights
        of women here.  The official US position on human rights is pretty clear
        and is somethign I've become very passionate about.

        not being his messenger boy!  I thought Artemis was pro-women!!!
