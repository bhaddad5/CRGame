        to have our very own capability to project power.  Finally, we are possessed
        of weapons equal to our wealth.  Yes, a most fruitful transaction for both
        parties, I assume?

        the Afrlurd Concordat.  The Overlord Concordat in your tongue.  It merely

        agrees to defer to the UAE and her regional allies with regards to all interaction
        between the US and the Middle East.

        are the regional allies for whom it is my honor to speak for.  Henceforth,
        the US will submit all requests to interact with us and we shall decide if
        and how we wish to respond.  This will prevent further destructive meddling
        in our various affairs.  Again, there will be no negotiations- you will sign
        and accept.
