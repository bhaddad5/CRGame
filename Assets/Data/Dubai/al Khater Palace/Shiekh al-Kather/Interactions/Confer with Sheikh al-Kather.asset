        And the American girl is a pretty thing-- sweet and surprisingly respectful! 
        Alsa, I am already dreading their eventual departure.  I am hoping those

        Doctor Quadir is our family physician and a most loyal fellow.  I'll send
        word to him-- he'll assist in whatever way required!  Is there anything else
        you need?
