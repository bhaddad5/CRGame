      Text: Shall I be honest?  I had hoped the familiarity might have made the girl
        less captivating to Zayed, but he seems even more enthralled by the girl. 
        We have scores of prettier Western girls here-- they flock like moths to
        money once their careers fail and many wind up 'yachting' here in the Gulf. 
        But none of them seem to hold a candle to this rather ordinary Jo Beth. 
        So... we must proceed after all.
