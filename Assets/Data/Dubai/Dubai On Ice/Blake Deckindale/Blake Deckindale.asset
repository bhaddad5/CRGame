  Bio: 'The once popular actress has sadly aged out of leading roles and with her
    agent absconding with much of her earnings, Blake''s made the move to Dubai in
    an attempt to secure funding for her own independent productions.  While she
    struggles to put together investment for her projects, it is well known that
    she''s available for ''private performances'' at reasonable rates. '
