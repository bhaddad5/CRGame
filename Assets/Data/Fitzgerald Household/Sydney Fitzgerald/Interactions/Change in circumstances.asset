        of some changes in the management of your trust fund.  Cynthia's been having
        issues at work and, well-- it's obvious she's no longer going to be able
        to pay the mortgage on your home here.

        Trustee to look after your trust fund.  Perkins Geary has recommended a new
        Trustee and the Family Court has approved the appointment.  DeShawn Owen
        will be your new Trustee.
