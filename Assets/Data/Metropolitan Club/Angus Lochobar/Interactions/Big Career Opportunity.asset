      Text: Your marketing girl has certainly turned into quite the little superstar! 
        We've become quite close through all this Jenny Page award campaign.  I'd
        like to see her someplace else where she could send business my way.

      Text: A start-up called Prime Mover.  It's a tech play that looks solid, unlike
        most of these vaporware operations.  They need a CEO-- one with an established
        track record in marketing.  Allison Riordan would be perfect-- but that's
        your call.
