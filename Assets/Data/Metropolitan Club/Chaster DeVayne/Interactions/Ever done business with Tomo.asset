      Text: Tomo!  Well, it would be hard not to have done business with them.  They
        are in shipping, steel, chemicals and in the last few years, they pushed
        into semiconductors and software.  Artemis must have some relationship with
        them.

        you said 'she'-- your CFO is a woman who used to work for Tomo?

      Text: Ha!  You don't know much about Japanese keiretsus, do you?  The idea
        that a woman would be sent over to represent Tomo is crazy.  They don't appoint
        women to anything more senior than Tea Girls at Tomo.  Well, maybe some minor
        PR jobs these days.
