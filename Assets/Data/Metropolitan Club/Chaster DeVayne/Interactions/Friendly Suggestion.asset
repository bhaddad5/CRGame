      Text: Very much so!  I think I gained a lot of goodwill with your help.  Gemma
        Hamilton seemed delighted with them-- especially your Dubai and Katangan
        leads.  She said it was very hard to break into those markets.

      Text: These so-called "International" experts tend to be a bit sketchy.  I've
        known a few that have sold themselves as having knowledge they didn't possess. 
        You might want to consult with MacAllister and ask if he might request a
        background check on your Gemma Hamilton-- just for peace of mind.

      Text: And fellow Metro Club member.  Yes.  He's been quite helpful to me when
        I've requested such help in the past.  He can pull in an Interpol report
        easily enough.  As long as you've made a campaign contribution, it shouldn't
        be a problem.
