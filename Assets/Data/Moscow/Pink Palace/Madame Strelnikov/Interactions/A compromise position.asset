      Text: That would work.  But there's another issue, one that may be an even
        bigger obstacle to a reciprocity arrangement.  You see, Selectacorp would
        NEVER permit the harvesting of underage targets.  It runs against the entire
        culture of the organization.

        your policy regarding females?  We'd be willing to wait to for those to reach
        the age of eighteen.  But the males-- if you don't catch them early enough
        in puberty, it is difficult to transform them convincingly.  You understand
