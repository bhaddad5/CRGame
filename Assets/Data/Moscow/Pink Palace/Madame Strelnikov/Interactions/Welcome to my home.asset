        times.  He ignored those warnings and a lesson was called for.  If we wanted
        all out war with Selectacorp, your people would not have been treated so
        tenderly, believe me.  But Phenex's arrogant disregard of our warnings was
        intolerable.  The world is changing, Mr. {LastName}.

        you want it back.  That leaves us with the Czechs... which really puts me
