      Text: 'He''s getting ready for school-- and his boyfriend.  Based on my analysis,
        it was the best training protocol to go with.  It is a scenario he understands,
        though assuming the female perspective is of course all new to him.  A simulated
        high school romance- though Drew is most definitely a ''naughty girl'' in
        these practice sessions! '

        leave them-- Drew is still very self conscious!  Have fun, kids!

      Text: Drew will position the practice partner on the bed.  The cameras will
        capture the activity while the sensors in the Practice Partner will register
        and respond to Drew's technique.  Failure results in rather painful remedial
        correction!
