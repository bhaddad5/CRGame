      Text: I am not Strelnikov.  My name is Tartofski-- Medical Director of this
        facility.  It is my pleasure to assist Stelnikov-- but this place is Strelnikov's
        vision, not mine.  I was a third assistant to a fourth deputy when Stelnikov
        rescued me from bureaucratic purgatory.  I like to think I have helped, in
        my own way, with the development of this place.

      Text: It is best you speak with Strelnikov-- but I do have so many questions! 
        I've examined Anna Sarin- what work!  What genius!  Of course I detected
        the chip but, as you warned, we attempted no retrieval.  Koschie would not
        allow it for one!  She's become so useful!  Could we discuss this AGATHA
        a bit more later?
