      Text: Yes!  Tartofski does excellent work.  Drew was a custom order, as are
        ALL our orders.  The Admiral was quite clear in his requirements-- an All
        American boy, somewhat athletic and thoroughly heterosexual.  Young, naive,
        fit and in every way 'normal'.  These Asians have all their conceptions based
        on consuming your exported television and movies.

      Text: Yes, well, we can discuss that later.  But to really get a sense of Tartofski's
        genius, you must review young Drew's file here.  Once we've concluded our
        business, assuming a reasonable outcome, you're free to visit Drew later
        if you like!

      Text: ...happy, normal American high school boy, once bound for college but
        now propelled towards a far darker future.  It appears his destiny is not
        to have a girlfriend but to be a girlfriend-- or a feminine companion of
        some type.
