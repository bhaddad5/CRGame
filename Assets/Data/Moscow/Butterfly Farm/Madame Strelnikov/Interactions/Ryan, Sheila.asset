      Text: My parents ranked among the top officialdom in the old Soviet era.  I
        grew up in a kind of a dream world.  The world was to be my oyster, Mr. {LastName}. 
        Then... History took a hand.  'Investors' with lots of American dollars began
        purging the old elites.  My parents were arrested.  Then they were murdered.

        I was placed in the state system.  It was called an orphange.  It was actually
