      Text: The client wanted a high powered young woman with a dominant personality. 
        Her American citizenship was a bonus but not a requirement.  Emma fit the
        bill nicely!  The desirability of such a strong will was the opportunity
        to tame it.  Emma, be a Good Girl for us.

      Text: There we are!  How nice!  You'll notice she seems a bit slow.  Emma's
        blood system is saturated with Inhibitors and suppressants-- and will be
        until she's judged to be a bit safer.  She's a strong young woman!
