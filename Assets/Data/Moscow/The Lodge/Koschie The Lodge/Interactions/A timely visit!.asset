      Text: It was important to introduce Anna to the Russian public in a very special
        way.  Of course, the good people of Nordlund were scandalized to see their
        former Prime Minister expose herself so shamelessly.  It was a difficult
        time for poor Anna, wasn't it My Dear?  Especially all those proud little
        Nordlund feminists who idolized you!
