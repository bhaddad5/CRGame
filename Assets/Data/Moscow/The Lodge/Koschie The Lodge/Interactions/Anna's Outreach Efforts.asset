      Text: Nonsense.  In the Imperial Era, it was a common practice for Russian
        aristocrats to acquire Nordlund mistresses, regardless of social rank.  Many
        Nordlund princesses found themselves as courtesans serving in the palaces
        of Moscow and St. Petersburg.  I'm merely resuming an old Russian tradition!

      Text: I understand her abrupt change in sympathies has created a political
        crisis in Nordlund and a new more neutral government has taken power.  Rumors
        swirl that Nordlund is preparing to abandon their recent treaty with the
        West- the one Prime Minister Sarin was so proud of.

      Text: Anna is providing just the kidn of role model Nordlund needs.  Cometh
        the hour, cometh the woman?  And she has personally been invested in creating
        warmed feelings towards Nordlund.  She's had audiences with MANY senior Russian
        government officials, not least the President!  Isn't that right, Anna?

      Text: More than 'met'.  Anna's been spreading the message of peace by spreading
        her legs-- a time honored form of Nordlund diplomacy, as I mentioned!  And
        as a former Prime Minister, she's been a prodigious source of classified
        information.  Which reminds me-- Anna, the FSB men would like to interview
        you again.
