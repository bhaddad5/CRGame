        at all, but it really is for his own good.  The more contact he has with
        the male practice doll, the easier it will be for him to submit to his Master
        when the time comes!  Quinn, go dress up for Date Night with Big Man!   '

      Text: Go on, Quinn!  No more stalling!  You know what to do!   He is still
        so damn stubborn!  I think that's why the Client wanted an American boy. 
        He says the Minions growing up under Prime rule are entirely too broken to
        offer any of the challenge so enjoyable in these types of relationships. 
        On your knees, Quinn!
