      Text: Would you like to play dress up, Quinn?  This was his Owner's idea. 
        Minion boys are often forced to dress this way when made to attend some rather
        risque parties by their Prime sponsors, os so the Commissioner tells me. 
        Put on your Princess costume, Quinn!

      Text: At least he's learned to smile... finally!  His Owner was not happy with
        Quinn's original response to dress up sessions.  Instructions were relayed. 
        But he's a smart boy-- a straight A student, don't you know!
