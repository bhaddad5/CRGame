        She didn't develop anything.  In fact, Artemis probably doesn't even have
        the rights to hald the IP it claims is it's own.

      Text: She used shell companies to cover her tracks but she basically scavenged
        other people's work, made slight changes and re-submitted it to get the patent
        in her own name.  It is a complete fraud.
