  Description: 'The Whitangan Reserve District (WRD) is a residential neighborhood
    designated exclusively for Whitangans.  All Whitangans not employed as domestics
    are restricted to living quarters in the WRD.  While not the most luxurious quarter
    of the city, the WRD is safe.  The Whitangan community has gradually come to
    embrace the WRD as their new homeland and some small businesses have even begun
    to emerge within the WRD, serving both Katangans and Whitangans alike. '
