      Text: No-- I'm here for fun.  I think I might like to work here though, when
        I graduate from university.  There seems to be lots of opportunities here
        but I've heard it is very difficult to get a visa to work here.  It's a little
        annoying, considering what a friend China has been to Katanga!

      Text: Well, it is!  China was the first nation to recognize Katanga diplomatically
        and also guaranteed Katangan independence when it looked like the West might
        intervene against the Peaceful Revolution!  You'd think they'd welcome Chinese
        people to come work here!

      Text: It only seems fair.  Perhaps they are a bit sensitive regarding foreign
        involvement.  Maybe things will change in the future.  Say, could I buy you
        a drink?  I'd love to learn more about you.
