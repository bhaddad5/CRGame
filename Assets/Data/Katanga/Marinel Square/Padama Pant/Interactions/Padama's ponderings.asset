        That IPO was legendary.  I'm Padama Pant, with Lotus Investments.  Is Artemis
        expanding here in Katanga?  Interesting-- if hardly a likely market for female
        empowerment enterprise technology!

      Text: Minerals-- what else?  Katanga is a giant mine stuffed with rare earth
        elements.  Though there are secondary sectors that look to be expanding off
        the base of that wealth.  I like what I see so far.  My firm was concerned
        Katanga might go full on Primevan and that would have been a huge red flag.

        measures.  '

      Text: You need to do your own groundwork, Mr. {LastName}, but perhaps you'll
        repay the favor in the future.  OK- here's what I've learned.  There is a
        group in the Katanga military that think more restrictive policies are needed
        to deal with Whitangans.  They're being egged on by the Primevan Military
        Attache- though the Consul General seems to belong to the more permissive
        Primevan faction.

      Text: They want full diplomatic recognition, instead of this sort of shadow
        acknowledgement.  They also see Katanga as a natural ally and they're also
        probably tired of being an international pariah.  Even the Chinese aren't
        thrilled with Primevan excesses.  It's all complicated and how it plays out
        will determine how Lotus will or will not make investments in Katanga.
