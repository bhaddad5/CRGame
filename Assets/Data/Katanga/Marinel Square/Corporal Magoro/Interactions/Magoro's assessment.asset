      Text: OK.  So there is the 1st Brigade based at Fort Boma, with a strength
        of 4,000.  We're mostly conscripts and the training is pretty basic- I only
        got 4 weeks.  We're pretty much all on foot and the weapons we're using are
        either old turned over Belgian guns or Chinese imports that are breaking
        all the time.

      Text: About 100,000- all on the borders with Congo, Angola and the DRC.  Everyone
        wants our mines, you see, Mr. {LastName}!  Or so they say.  But all the troopers
        think it is ridiculous.  Typical officers-- they want twice the men to do
        a job for which half would be fine-- if we were better trained and equipped
        and didn't have to move by foot.

      Text: Look, Mr. {LastName}- all we want is to get on with our lives.  We don't
        mind doing our part for Katanga, but it is stupid.  We have no armour, not
        even trucks, no AA, no artillery and our small arms suck.  As for me, all
        I want is to get on with my business, get married, have a family- and maybe
        score a nice Whitangan mistress on the side, right?
