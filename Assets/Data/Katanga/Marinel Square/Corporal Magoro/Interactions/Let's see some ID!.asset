        Square.  I should have known from the quality of your clothes you're no local. 
        My mistake.  You won't report me, will you Sir?  I was just doing my duty! 
        Western tourists are still very rare, so I naturally assumed--

        protest?

      Text: From Whitangans, Sir?  Ha- no.  They're are tame as pussycats.  No Sir,
        it is more about making sure they are at their places of work.  Between us,
        I have nothing against Whitangans, as long as they follow the law.  But it
        seems a waste of time to have so many of us guarding so few of them-- just
        between us, Sir.

        work?  Arrest me and take me to a prison or something?

      Text: Oh, hardly Sir!  I'd just give you a warning and send you on your way
        to your job!  Why waste a perfectly able bodied Whitangan by putting him
        in a jail cell?  It just seems unfair that when there's so much money to
        be made, here I am, conscripted and stuck in uniform for another six months! 
        I'm missing the boat!  Oh well, no use complaining!

        nothing for the boys stationed there.  I can already get my hands on some
        starting money and I have a location picked out.  I'd hire some sexy Whitangan
