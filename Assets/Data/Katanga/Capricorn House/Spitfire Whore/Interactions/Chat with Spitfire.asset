      Text: Charlotte de Vos.  At one time, it was even Constable de Vos.  I guess
        that's how I ended up here.  My husband and I met at the Police Academy. 
        I was assigned to Internal Affairs and he went to Vice.  That's where he
        made the biggest mistake of his life.  He busted Mr. Kanyinda and not once
        but a bunch  of times!  He was running Katangan girls back then.

      Text: After the 'Peaceful Revolution', he wound up starting this place up. 
        Hubby and I were booted from the force of course...  and Mr. K has friends
        in the new police force.  He suggested things might get difficult if I didn't
        work for him.  But it wasn't all bad.  He let me do a freebie so hubby could
        get a job working for Equatorial.

        a job as a Tea Boy in the offices.  It is much better and safer than working
        the shafts.  He doesn't know anything about it, of course.  He's very proud.
