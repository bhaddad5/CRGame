      Text: One thing, Sir.  Capricorn has a flat rate for all offerings-- there's
        no need to negotiate.  Also, please don't tip the girls.  They all earn well
        above what the average Whitangan girl makes and tipping only introduces jealousy
        and strife.  They also know if I catch wind of it, they're out on their ass
        immediately!
