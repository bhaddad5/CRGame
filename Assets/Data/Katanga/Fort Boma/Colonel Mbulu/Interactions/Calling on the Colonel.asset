      Text: Young Joseph said you'd be making a visit.  {LastName}, isn't it?  I
        understand you represent some Western technology company.  I'll be straight
        with you-- the Katangan Army is hardly a modern military force!  We're making
        do with rifles older than my recruits!

      Text: If the President refuses to give me money to properly outfit our men,
        I have no choice but to make up for it but with numbers.  Our regional neighborhood
        is a dangerous one and there's a lot of envy because of our rare earth mineral
        wealth.  We must defend our frontiers!  Young Joseph knows this-- he does
        what he can with the influence his clan has.

      Text: You've done your homework, haven't you Mr. {LastName}?  And for that,
        I'll give you this.  We haven't had much luck modernizing and even if we
        did, no major arms dealers in the West would work with us.  There is one
        nation that is keen to do so-- but the President, in his wisdom, has kept
        them at arm's length.

        No, I'm talking about Primeva.  They have a consulate here.  I could make
