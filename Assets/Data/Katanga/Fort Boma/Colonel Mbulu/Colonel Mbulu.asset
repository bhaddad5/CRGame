  Bio: The commanding officer of the 1st Brigade was instrumental in providing the
    military muscle required to force the minority government to surrender under
    threat of mass executions.  Many speculate he was disappointed at being so  robbed
    of the chance to end the threat to the Revolution once and for all.
