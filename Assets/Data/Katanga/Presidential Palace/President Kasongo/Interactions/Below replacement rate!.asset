        all the policies we had hoped would boost Whitangan birth rates but so far,
        there''s been no improvement!  My intelligence service reports that Whitangans
        might be more loyal and grateful-- but the babies aren''t being born!'

      Text: It seems the problem is with the Whitangan men.  As you know, many of
        the policies have been designed to normalize and formalize societal dynamics. 
        And while they don't dare object, it appears the boys are very resentful
        over losing their women to Katangan men.  It seems they are on a bit of a
        sex strike!

        home office and speak with my Technology Chief about this.  There may be
        a solution.

      Text: If you can crack this one, you'll have a government contract.  I'd hate
        to have to turn to more direct methods in dealing with this situation.  There's
        no way to put this toothpaste back into the tube.  Katangan men aren't going
        to restrain themselves out of respect for Whitangan boys, especially if all
        this is legal and voluntary now.
