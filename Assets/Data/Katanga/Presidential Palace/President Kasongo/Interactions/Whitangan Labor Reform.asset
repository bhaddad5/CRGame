      Text: Mr. President, your forward thinking reforms are having a major effect
        on Katanga.  But there is one area where there is still a bit of pushback. 
        By classifying Whitangans as a national resource, they've experienced some
        improvement of their living standard but there's still resistance on the
        part of the police--

      Text: Mr. President, roll out a very public set of labor reforms.  Force Katangan
        employers to agree to twelve hour shifts.  Allow for paid Materinity Leave
        to increase the Whitangan birthrate.  Implement a minimum wage for Whitangans. 
        Then the police will have no choice but to enforce it-- or face a huge backlash!
