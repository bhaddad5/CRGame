      Text: Mr. President, the old colonial hypocrisy regarding relations between
        the two social groups is creeping rapidly into Katangan society and it is
        having the same poisonous impact.  Would you consider an alternative approach
        to what Nature will make inevitable?

      Text: Normalize and formalize these relationships, Mr. President.  This would
        acknowledge the reality while insuring such arrangements must be voluntary
        and there must be compensation for the Whitangans involved-- and of course
        require Whitangans be of legal majority to agree to such terms as well.

      Text: I'm calling it a Companion Compensation Policy whereby Whitangans voluntarily
        agreeing a period of sexual service be compensated to a fair amount and that
        such a contract would be limited to an agreed upon period of time.  If Whitangans
        are being compensated, there will be no animosity or feeling of exploitation--
        which is the current situation.

      Text: Or not.  Such as in the case of my sister and her Whitangan maid.  You
        look surprised.  Of course I've known about that little scandal.  What my
        sister doesn't know is how she's being manipulated-- that little violinist
        she's so enamoured with is only using her to get an Exit Visa- which I will
        NEVER allow.

        to impress.  What do you think of the idea of at least allowing Whitangan
        girls to get paid for being mistresses of powerful Katangans?
