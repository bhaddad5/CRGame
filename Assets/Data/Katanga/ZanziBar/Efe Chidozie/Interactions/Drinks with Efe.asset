        make an exception.  You've been a busy boy, haven't you {FirstName}?  You've
        managed to gain audiences with the three most powerful clans in this country
        and, through them, push some fairly radical agendas.  Do you deny it?

        LEGAL opportunities, I must stress, Efe!

      Text: How about off the record then?  For example, my sources suggest a military
        assistance treaty between Katanga and Primeva's in the works-- due to you. 
        That because of a white paper you've prepared that the Ministry of Resources
        is soon to be enlarged.  And let's not forget some analysis you've conducted
        for Equatorial Mining regarding some rumored production crisis they are experiencing.

      Text: Well, since this is off the record, you might say I was instrumental
        in those activities but as an outsider, I'm hardly the decision maker, am
        I?  I'm merely a consultant, Efe.  Nothing nefarious about any of that is
        there?  Aren't the news items you mentioned very positive developments for
        Katanga?

      Text: Sometimes it takes an outsider's perspective to get an objective perspective
        on local problems.  As for what I get out of it, I'd like to do more business
        here and need the right conditions in order to do so.  There are parties
        which believe Katanga has a bright future and by offering friendship now,
        I'm simply building a foundation of goodwill for future cooperation.
