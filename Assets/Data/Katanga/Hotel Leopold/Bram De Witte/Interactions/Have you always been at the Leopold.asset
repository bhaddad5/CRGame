      Text: Just since the Peaceful Revolution, Sir.  I was a police detective but
        like many Whitangans, that profession was no longer open to me.  I was very
        grateful to be hired by Ms. Lunda, who took over as General Manager here.

      Text: It was the price we had to pay for peace-- a price well worth paying,
        Sir!  Whitangans had to make way for Katangans in the professions, the civil
        service and the armed forces.  We were able to move into those roles that
        Katangans were no longer interested in.
