      Text: Mr. Bram, what about enjoying the company of a Ktangan girl?  The ladies
        I've met so far are stunningly gorgeous.  Surely some might be open to taking
        my money in exchange for their favors?

        You might be overheard.  Whitangan men have been thrashed for so much as
        looking at a Katangan lady the wrong way!  You are a foreigner and so immune
        from that kind of treatment BUT you might find your visa revoked in short
        order! '

      Text: 'Surely, but only those they share common cultural ties with, such as
        men from neighboring African nations.  It is true that Katangan men do enjoy
        spending time with Whitangan girls, but the opposite is true of Katangan
        ladies.  You''ll find them polite but reserved, Sir.  You must respect the
        unspoken boundaries of Katanga-- or risk harm to yourself! '
