        noticed.  I've seen the comings and goings here and I dare say more deals
        are negotiated here at the King Leopold than any government ministry!

        all but if you really want to understand who pulls the strings, look to the
        Three Families, Sir.  The real power is in their hands.

      Text: The Banzas, the Kashimbas and the Kashongos.  Sometimes they work together,
        sometimes against and the combinations change on every issue you might imagine. 
        When they do come together though, things happen in Katanga-- for good or
        ill!
