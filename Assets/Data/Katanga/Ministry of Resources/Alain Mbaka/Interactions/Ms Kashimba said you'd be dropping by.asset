        focus.  I understand your Ministry is key to the Katangan economy.  The rare
        earth minerals your mines produce are sought all over the world.  What are
        the major challenges facing the Ministry of Resources these days?  '

        with the major mine operators and we work very closely with Equatorial Mining. 
        We have good alignment and an effective public-private sector partnership. '

      Text: Thank you, Mr. {LastName}!  I would say within our silo, we are very
        effective.  It is in the areas outside our jurisdiction that prove frustrating. 
        Absenteeism, uneven productivity, even social issues-- these are all far
        more challenging than the operations of the ministry or the mine operators. 
        Whitangan labor, Mr. {LastName}-- that's often the issue.

        of these kinds of issues.  Let me confer with her on all this.  I'll make
