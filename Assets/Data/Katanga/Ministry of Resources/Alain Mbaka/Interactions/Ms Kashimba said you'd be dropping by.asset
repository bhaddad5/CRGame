        focus.  I understand your Ministry is key to the Katangan economy.  The rare
        earth minerals you rmines produce are sought all over the world.  What are
        the major challenges facing the Minsitry of Resources these days?  '

      Text: Thank you, Mr. {LastName}!  I would say within our silo, we are very
        effective.  It is in the areas outside our jurisdiction that prove frustrating. 
        Abseentism, uneven productivity, even social issues-- these are all far more
        challenging than the operations of the ministry or the mine operators.  Whitangan
        labor, Mr. {LastName}-- that's often the issue.
