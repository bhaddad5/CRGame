      Text: It is true that when I still owned this cafe, I never refused to serve
        Katangans.  But that's no longer my choice.  The new owners feel Whitangans,
        unless they are in service, are not to be served.  They feel it lowers the
        tone of the cafe and puts off Katangans from patronizing the business.

      Text: I was forced to sell.  I needed to raise money for an Exit Visa for my
        son.  I was fortunate to be kept on as a server.  I'm very grateful to the
        new owners- I'm no longer young or pretty and they could easily have found
        a pretty Whitangan girl for the job.  But I know the business so well, they
        felt it was worth keeping me on.
