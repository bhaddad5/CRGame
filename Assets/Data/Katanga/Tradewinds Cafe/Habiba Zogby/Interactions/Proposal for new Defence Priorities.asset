      Text: Professor?  I've made significant progress with Colonel Mbulu and the
        Primevans.  I think there may be an opportunity to get the Banza clan behind
        it, which would create an opportunity for myself.

      Text: Professor, could you take my notes and turn them into a proper proposal
        for me to present to Mr. Banza?  If it is as compelling as I think it will
        be, the Banzas will quickly get behind it.  I can take whatever draft you
        give me back to my corporate lawyers and have them format it according to
        Katangan requirements.
