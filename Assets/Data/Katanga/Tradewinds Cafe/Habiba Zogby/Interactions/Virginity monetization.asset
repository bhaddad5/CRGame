      Text: Professor, I've had the most extraordinary offer put to me.  I won't
        bother with the details, but I've been offered the virginity of an eighteen
        year old Whitangan girl for not a great deal of money.  She says this is
        becoming common among Whitangan girls and I suspect it could become a problem.

      Text: 'I''m not shocked.  I understand during the colonial era and the era
        of minority rule that it was common for the European transplants to take
        Katangan mistresses.  Turn about is fair play, yes?  What is the girl planning
        to do with the money-- which must be significant to her, considering normal
        Whitangan wages? '

      Text: Basically as a dowry to help her and some Whitangan boy get married and
        settle down.  Admirable in its own way.  And pragmatic as well.  She said
        she knows some Katangan work superior will have his way with her anyway so
        she may as well get paid for her sacrifice.  Is there any advantage in systemitizing
        all this in a legal and public way?

      Text: I see a policy of virginity regsitration and contractual law put around
        this as being beneficial to both Whitangans and Katangans.  It would place
        a monetary value on Whitangan virginity, allow for some minor wealth transfer
        and boost Whitangan marraige rates-- all good things that will bring Katanga
        stability!

        way for Whitangan girls to auction off their virginity.  It seems only fair
        to present it to Dimena Kashimba, whose very own household inspired, if indirectly,
        the new scheme! '
