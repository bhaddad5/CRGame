      Text: Based on the data and the transcript of your interview with this Whitangan
        foreman, the first thing that immediately stands out is the need to close
        this government Exit Visa loophole immediately.  Katangan needs Whitangans
        more than it needs their money!

      Text: Fine, fine-- but we should propose making it much more expensive or difficult
        to apply for.  It still won't do much to close the worker gap.  And there's
        no point in trying to motivate Katangans back into the mines.  They hate
        them and are glad Whitangans have had to take their place.  They are engaged
        in far more lucrative careers these days.

      Text: Didn't the foreman say something about having no time to spend with his
        wife?  There's the long term solution-- Whitangan birth rates must be increased
        dramatically.  Katanga needs a Whitangan Baby Boom and it needs one as soon
        as possible!

      Text: 'Let me work on this a bit.  We''ll need a series of regulations that
        would actively reward Whitangan fertility, some which will cost Katangan
        businesses and taxpayers in the short to mid term.  I''ll need to do some
        forecasting models in order to demonstrate how some immediate costs will
        end up benefiting Katanga in the long run.  I''ll shoot you the draft when
        it''s ready. '
