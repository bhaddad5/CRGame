        Resources is to widen the ministry''s scope.  It also requires recognizing
        a basic truth that Katangan officials seem to assume but never officially
        acknowledge. '

      Text: Whitangans, of course!  Whitangans are a resource and should be officially
        defined as such.  Further more, I'd propose that Whitangans, as a national
        resource, should fall administeratively under the Ministry of Resources. 
        They are as critical as the ore they mine, Mr. {LastName}!
