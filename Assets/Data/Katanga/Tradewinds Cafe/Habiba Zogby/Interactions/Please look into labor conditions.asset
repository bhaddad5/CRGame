      Text: Professor, I'm getting a sense that working conditions for the average
        Whitangan are very, very bad.  I suspect it may actually be crippling the
        Katangan economy.  With Katangans refusing to take on jobs involving physical
        labor, Whitangans have been pushed into those roles and no one is looking
        out for their best interests.

      Text: True but the Peaceful Revolution made all that inevitable.  Now that
        their roles are reversed, you can't expect Katangans to be any more concerned
        with Whitangan safety that the Whitangans were previously with Katangan industrial
        casualties.

      Text: True-- but there are many fewer Whitangans than Katangans.  The loss
        of a Whitangan has a much more disproportinate effect on the economy.  I
        need you to draw up a proposal justifying labor reforms that not only protect
        Whitangan workers but also limit exploitation.  These 18 hour days will end
        up destroying the Katangan mining sector!

      Text: 'NOTE: The Professor''s final proposal is succinct and persuasive.  Unless
        worker protections for Whitangans are put into place. the Katangan economy
        is put in peril!  You''ll need to get President Kashingo''s support for what
        will be seen as Whitangan ''coddling'' by many!'
