  Description: Joseph Feza's dream has always been to bring the magic of Las Vegas,
    where he worked many years as a pit boss to his Katnagan homeland.  He was quick
    in sourcing funding following the Peaceful Revolution and his vision is now a
    reality.  The Majo is rapidly becoming one of the most visited casinos in Sub
    Saharan Africa!
