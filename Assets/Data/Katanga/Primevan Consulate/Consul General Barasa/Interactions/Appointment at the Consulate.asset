        Just as Katanga must decide it's own course.  I'm simply here to find if
        there isn't a way for my form to assist them.  I understand Primeva would
        like to do the same but has been rebuffed by the current President.

      Text: President Kashongo is a humanitarian who believes in nonviolence.  Persoanlly,
        I agree with him.  He believes in re-integration between Katangans and Whitagans--
        within limits.  I am of the same belief, though the debate rages in Primeva
        even now.  And we actually have already assisted the President in one important
        respect.

      Text: No.  In another area in which Primeva has done a bit of pioneering- but
        unfortunately, it is a classified matter and my diplomat's mouth has opened
        too wide once again!  Mr. {LastName}, we're happy to work with yourself as
        intermediary if your aim is to help modernize the Katangan Army.  I'll have
        you work with our military attache to sort the details.

      Text: Ah, you come straight to the point!  Very good!  Very good!  We currently
        enjoy a kind of limited diplomatic recognition by Katanga.  They allow us
        this Consulate.  However, what we-- I-- really want is full diplomatic recognition
        and the upgrade of this consulate to a fully accredited embassy.

      Text: It would only be appropriate and respectful to appoint an ambassador--
        and as the currently serving Consul General, it would only make sense...
        well, need I say more?  Good luck, Mr. {LastName}-- I do hope you succeed
        in bringing Katanga and Primeva closer together!
