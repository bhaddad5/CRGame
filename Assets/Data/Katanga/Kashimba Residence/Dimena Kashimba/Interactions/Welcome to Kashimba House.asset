        I understand there was some unpleasantness on the part of my witless maid
        Pamela- isn't that right, Pammy?

      Text: No, Mr. {LastName}- believe me, giving these Whitangan slags any slack
        is a very bad idea!  Pammy, instead of being allowed your customary Saturday
        night off, you will muck out the attic.  Understand?

      Text: Dismissed.  Now. Mr. {LastName}- what shall we discuss?  I understand
        your firm is involved in promting female empowerment- but as you can see,
        we Katangan women hardly need assistance in that area!

        consulting services here in Katanga than our technology solutions.  I'm here
        in that capacity.

      Text: 'Interesting.  As you may know, the Kashimbas are very involved in government
        service.  Perhaps they might be scope for some improvements in the civil
        administration.  I would have Katangan governance as a model for other nations
        emerging from colonialism. '

      Text: Very well.  I'm directing you to speak with Minister Mbaka.  He's the
        Minister for Resources and probably has the most important portfolio in the
        whole government.  Resources is responsible for managing Katanga's mineral
        wealth.  If there's any improvement we can make there, it would flow on to
        the benefit of the whole country!
