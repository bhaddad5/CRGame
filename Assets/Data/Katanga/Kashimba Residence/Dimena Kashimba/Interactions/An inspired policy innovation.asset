      Text: Pammy--  Mr. {LastName} is here to see me, not my maid.  Attend to your
        duties-- I want my boudoir impeccable and you must attend to your laundry! 
        I'm sorry for that.  These Whitangan girls can get so chatty.  They forget
        their place far too often.  Why have you come then?

        at a method for regulating this situation!  Imagine how wanton these Whitangan
        girls are!  My goodness!  Of course, I like your proposal and I will support
        it, but I'll need some encouraging signal from the President.  Wouldn't want
        to be seen as being too pre-occupied with such things!
