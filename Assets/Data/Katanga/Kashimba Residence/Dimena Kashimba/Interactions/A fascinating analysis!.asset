      Text: I must admit Mr. {LastName}, I did not expect such an inspired proposal! 
        By empowering the Minsitry of Resources to oversee Whitangans, you've cut
        through multiple, confusing and overlapping Katangan authorities like the
        Gordian Knot.  Very nicely done!

      Text: Thank you!  Our thinking is that by centralizing authority, Whitangans
        will benefit as well.  And better managed Whitangans will be better motivated,
        happier and more productive.  It works to the advantage of all parties.

      Text: Perhaps.  In any case, the important point is that our ministry is now
        able to more effectively coordinate policies and planning.  That should help
        start to address our macro issues!  I'll speal to teh President-- with your
        proposal submitted under my name, I have no doubt he'll agree to authorize
        it!  I am in your debt, Mr. {LastName}.  Now if you'll excuse me-- Pammy!
