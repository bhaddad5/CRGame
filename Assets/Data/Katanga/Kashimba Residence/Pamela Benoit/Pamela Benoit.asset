  Bio: Pamela once operated, briefly, her own highly successful travel agency.  After
    the "Peaceful Revolution" she was forced to sell her business and seek other
    'more suitable' employment.  Her intelligence and ability to plan made her a
    standout applicant for the Ladies Maid position with the Kashimba family.  "Pammy"
    now serves her mistress as maid and social secretary.
