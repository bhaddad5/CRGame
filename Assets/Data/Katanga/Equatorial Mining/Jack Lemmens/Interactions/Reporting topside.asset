        you used to run Equatorial.

        I hardly ever see my wife and when I do, I'm a zombie.  The Whitangan staff
        are busting their asses down there but the problem is simple.  Katangans
        don't want to work in the mines and there just aren't enough of us Whitangans
        to meet the goals.
