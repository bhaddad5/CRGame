      Text: Albert Yumba, at your service, Mr. {LastName}.  Ms. Kashongo said you
        were looking for consulting opportunities.  I'm not sure what those might
        be.  We're a fairly basic mining operation, the biggest in Katanga, but still
        very similar to any other mining company in the world.  Are you in the mining
        sector?

        tailored to each client.  What would you say your biggest challenges are
        here, Mr. Yumba?

      Text: Not one you're likely to solve for us, unfortunately.  Our problem, Mr.
        {LastName}, is that we simply don't have enough workers to meet our current
        production quotas!  The world is hungry for rare earth minerals and we simply
        don't have the manpower we need to supply it!

        outside Katanga?

      Text: 'We''ve done as much automation as we can but even then you still need
        fingers to push the buttons!  As for inviting in foreign expertise, President
        Kashongo feels it would make us too reliant on outsiders.  It is a shame
        we granted so many Whitangans Exit Visas after the Peaceful Revolution! '

      Text: It was supposedly a humanitarian initiative but it was really just a
        cash grab.  Wealthy Whitangans were allowed to purchase Exit Visas.  They
        weren't allowed to take much money out of the country but they did buy their
        freedom.  But it also meant that long term we lost many of the best and brightest
        Whitangans and we could use them now down in the mines!
