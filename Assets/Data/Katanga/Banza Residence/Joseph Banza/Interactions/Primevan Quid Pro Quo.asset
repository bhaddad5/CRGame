      Text: It was quite a coup.  The officer corp is onboard with this new direction
        and Primeva has agreed to not only sell us the weapons systems suggested
        in your original proposal, they are sending advisors as well.  All in all,
        a major show of support for our heroes in uniform!

      Text: They must be patient.  I've used quite a bit of my political capital
        in making this treaty happen.  Perhaps if the idea came from an objective
        outsider-- like yourself-- the President might be open to considering it. 
        However, I couldn't be seen to be involved in anyway-- my motivations would
        be suspected.
