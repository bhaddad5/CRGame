        performing in the symphony, right before the Peaceful Revolution and knew
        I had to have her.  As the President''s sister, I knew I could have her application
        for an Exit Visa denied and then I offered her a job here. '

      Text: My word is my bond, Ms. Kashongo.  I also think your... situation isn't
        at all unique.  I've noticed many relationships between Katangans and Whitangans. 
        They seem to range from reluctant to outright affection, such as the one
        betwen you and your maid.  Perhaps it is a situation that requires more transprency.
