  Description: 'The Kashongo clan had worked in the mines for years.  With the advent
    of the "Peaceful Revolution", their claim to the resource sector was acknowledged
    and they now have majority stakes in the major mining companies.  While most
    of the clan is content to enjoy the high life afforded by the dividends rolling
    out of their holdings, Therese, the eldest daughter, has taken a more hands off
    approach.  Her active participation in management decisions make sher a regular
    in Equatorial Mining board meetings, as well as numerous indsutry and national
    forums. '
