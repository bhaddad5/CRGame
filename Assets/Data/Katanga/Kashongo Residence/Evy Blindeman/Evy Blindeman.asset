  Bio: The humble uniform of a domestic hides a musical talent that was once a highly
    sought pianist who once toured extensively throughout the world.  Following the
    "Peaceful Revolution", she was forced to leave her position with the Southern
    Hemisphere Symphony Orchestra.  While talented, Evy's career had not allowed
    her to accumulate the kind of money required to purchase an Exit Visa.  Like
    many semi-famous Whitangans, she was able to secure stable employment as a member
    of an influential Katangan family's domestic staff.
