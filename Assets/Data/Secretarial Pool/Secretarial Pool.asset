  Description: 'Officially known as the Administrative Resource Center, this department
    is run by an Office Manager and staffed by various Office Girls.  The SecPool
    is used to cover off on overflow work from other departments which is typically
    clerical in nature.  SecPool assignments include filing, typing, scanning and
    cataloguing corporate assets of all types.  While not terribly glamourous, the
    SecPool does offer hard working admins the opportunity for exposure to company
    executives and a stepping stone to potential promotion to secretarial roles that
    open up throughout the company. '
