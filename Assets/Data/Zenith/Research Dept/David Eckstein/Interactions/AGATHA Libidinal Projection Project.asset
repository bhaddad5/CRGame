        be able to track the subluminal impact of her AGATHA conditioning.  I'd like
        to check her response to external suggestions regarding her attitude... towards
        you, actually.

      Text: As to 'why', wouldn't it be beneficial to have an AGATHA trained assistant
        to exhibit intense feelings of loyalty and even attraction?  As to how, it
        is as simple as an assigned reading list.  You like her to dress up as a
        schoolgirl-- why not ask her for a book report?

        you''ll need to discuss it with her directly.'
