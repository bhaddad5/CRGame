      Text: '{FirstName}, Thistle Hall would be ideal for what you want!   It''s
        huge-- loads of bedrooms and baths-- and yet you could get lost in it!  It
        is one of the largest estates in the district-- VERY old money!  The previous
        owners installed a fully modern spa wing which is absolutely sumptuous.'

        really another floor of the home-- that just needs some finishing off to
        be usable.  It might be suitable for a, well, playroom of sorts if one was
        so inclined...
