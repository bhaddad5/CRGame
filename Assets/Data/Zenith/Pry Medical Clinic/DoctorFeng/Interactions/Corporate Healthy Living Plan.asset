        staff!  How commendable!  A corporate wellness program would easily pay it's
        costs back and more in reducung absenteeism and sick days.

      Text: Many progressive organizations offer a cafeteria for their staff.  Your
        admin staff wouldn't require much-- a basic food services unit and some space
        for some tables.  I'd recommend Pomeroy's for such services, guided by a
        menu designed by Pry.

        nutricious but bland.  To keep costs down, I''d only offer one meal option
        daily-- and restrict breakfast to basic cereal and milk.  Keep it all nice
        and simple for your admin girls-- and very, very cheap.  '
