      Text: I'm delighted to officially release Tracey Bledsoe into your custody. 
        I think we here at Pry Clinic are all enormously proud of the progress Tracey's
        made since she's been with us.

      Text: Please convey my gratitude to all your staff here for a job well done. 
        It is obvious that Tracey is a completely re-adjusted woman who is prepared
        to re-enter society.

      Text: I think as long as you keep a tight leash on her, she'll perform well
        in whatever capacity you decide she's fit for.  While we can attend to the
        final paperwork whenever you like, I might suggest we sort out Tracey's Power
        of Attorney as soon as possible in the main office.

      Text: That's an excellent suggestion.  Once you let Tracey out of her restraints,
        we should go do that as soon as possible.  With her Power of Attorney, I'll
        have the last bit of paperwork to allow me to do  whatever I want with her.
