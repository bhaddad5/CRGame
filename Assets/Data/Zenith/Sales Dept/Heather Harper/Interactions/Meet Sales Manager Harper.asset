        days!  Perhaps you know what''s going on.  I go make a few sales calls and
        my Sales Director gets blown up and we have a new guy all of a sudden?  '

      Text: Yes, it was all very unfortunate.  Under the circumstances, I'd say everyone
        is better off, even Cynthia.  You'll like DeShawn-- I happen to know he respects
        the hard work you've done to keep things together in Sales.

        and see how things play out?  You might like the way things are shaking out-
