      Text: Rough day today.  I had to demote Cindy.  I told her she's going to have
        to go back into the field again as a sales rep.  She's no longer the Artemis
        Director of Sales.  I've eliminated the position.

        she wouldn't be able to hold onto her house now.  She said she's not even
        allowed to sell it, since it is part of the trust until her stepdaughter
        turns twenty-five.
