      Text: I thought it was some weird new European type shop at first.  It was
        all empty and dark and creepy.  Then this odd dude named Dr. Zlo popped out
        and once he knew I was there by mistake, he practically threw me out.  Before
        he did, I did see some weird stuff though-- like hi tech torture machines! 
        Place is called OBEIR.
