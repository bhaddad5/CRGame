        someone responsible for keeping it running smoothly and keeping it from spinning
        into chaos.  All these women-- well, they need someone running herd on them. 
        A Dormitory Matron to lay down the law.  I was thinking you'd be perfect
        for it.

      Text: You'd have your own private suite and have authority over all the residents,
        even girls I sponsor for the dorm.  You'd set the rules and maintain order. 
        I want you to come up with the Dorm Rules and the consequences if they are
        broken.  You'll continue on as Purchasing Manager but by giving up your apartment,
        you'd be saving more of your salary.  What do you think?

        charge?  And if the rules were broken... I'd get to decide what happens? 
        Hmmm.  Interesting.  I'm... really flattered that you'd think of me for this
        Dormitory Matron opportunity!  So, you really think I'm ready for this kind
        of rersponsibility?

        in charge of all those girls-- but I think you're exactly the kind of responsible
        and firm woman these girls need.  What do you say?
