  Bio: Give her a call in advance and Britney will make sure her roommates are out
    of the picture and get into something she hopes you'll find appealing.  Of course,
    there's no way you can stop her from bragging at the office about her 'secret
    executive boyfriend' no matter how much you deny the relationship!
