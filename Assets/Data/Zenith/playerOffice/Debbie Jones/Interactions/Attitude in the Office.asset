      Text: I just wanted to commend this positive attitude you've been showing recently. 
        It's been noticed and I approve!  You've becoming an excellent example for
        the other Office Girls.  Keep it up, Debbie!  I knew once I was promoted
        to General Manager, you'd start conducting yourself in a more agreeable way.

      Text: Debbie, you've been way too stand-offish recently.  You need to loosen
        up and be the perky little secretary I require!  I think a demerit might
        help motivate an improved attitude!  I assumed that once I was promoted to
        General Manager, you'd start conducting yourself in a more agreeable way.
