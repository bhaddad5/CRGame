      Text: I actually think it was a kind of a goof.  Dr. E. came up with this crazy
        implant that filled my head with a voice.  It was way too loud at first and
        they had a lot of adjustments.  I think Mr. {LastName} did it as a test to
        see what I would put up with.  All kinds of outrageous, sexist 'suggestions'--
        it was just so silly!  I pretended to go along with it to get the cash.
