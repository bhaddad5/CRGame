        You don't run across many bona fide geniuses in life-- Smith is one.  I shared
        it all with him--AGATHA, the lot.  He gets it.  As for Somatics-- what he
        shared was mind blowing.  What he's proposing fits our own R&D like a GLOVE. 
        From a technology perspective-- it could not be a better fit.  AI plus AE
        IS the future!

        well, they're massive {FirstName}.  Based on Dr. E's market valuation calcs,
        we're talking about a deal that's in the hundreds of millions.  Even with
        some brilliant accounting, we'd need outside financing, which would open
        us up to audits that I'm not so sure we want-- given some of the aspects
        of our products.

        to a straight acquisition- he rightly says that's cleaner.  BUT Prometheus
        runs as an autonomous subsidiary.  He'd report to you directly and make all
        decisions relating to research.  Artemis would have to commit to an annual
        black box budget in the UK of fifty million per annum.
