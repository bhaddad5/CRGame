        proposal-- it was actually inspired by the way you handle Blondie out there. 
        Those schoolgirl outfits of hers-- have you noticed it has been picked up
        by many of your managers?

        is forced to skip around in a school uniform.  It suggested that secretarial
        wardrobe has a very positive iimpact on executive morale and that there was
        an opportunity to institutionalize the custom.  I propose a monthly Admin
        Dress Up Day.
