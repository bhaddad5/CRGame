        why?  It isn't like she's in love with me.  When she washed out of the Management
        Trainee Program, she pleaded with me to keep her on.  She was desperate and
        she was the one who offered me 'extra services' if I retained her which I
        did.  What would you have done?

        he has higher political aspirations but he needs a good second in charge
        managing the shop for him to free him up for more active campaigning.  We've
        already discussed potential Assistant DAs and we both agreed you're the man
        for the job.

        a nice family of good standing.  Slumming with a secretary is all fine and
        dandy for a lark but you're going to have to do a lot better than Debbie. 
        And you can.  And if you don't believe me, ask your boss.  He'll tell you
        the same thing, Eugene.
