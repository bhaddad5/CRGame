        Tyson actually.  It says "It looks like we're going to have a new addition
        to our little clan.  It seems my slut foster daughter has got herself knocked
        up.  Of course I'm not surprised, given what a little tramp she is."

        after this.  You suspect a few times more.  He's always talked about having
        a large family and the job would hardly be a chore with the still lovely--
        and now very domesticated-- Deirdre.
