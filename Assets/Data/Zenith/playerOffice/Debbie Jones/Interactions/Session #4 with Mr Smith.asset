      Text: We'll have as many sessions as I require, Debbie.  Now, let's get back
        to the way your job changed.  Let's see-- there's a memo from Mr. {LastName}
        to an executives only distribution list that designates you as falling under
        'Executive Privilege'- what is that?  And there's a waiver here that I see
        you signed.  Tell me about that too.

        meant that if I wanted to date some guy I had to submit an application. 
        It all had to do with ''sensitive company information'' Mr. {LastName} was
        worried I might spill on a date.  But you know what?  I got a call from a
        guy in my B School class who was in town for business.  He asked me out--
        just for a coffee-- and I said yes!   '

        go out on a date like I was in Junior High!  It was going great too-- until
        I saw Britney Bower.  It was no secret- she's been Mr. {LastName}'s spy since
        he started.  I had to ditch my date-- it was so embarrassing!  After that,
        I stopped bothering.  What was the point?

      Text: What about it?  I signed it, didn't I?  They said it was to stop fake
        harassment claims, but all it really did was let bosses take liberties without
        having to worry about any consequences.  Every since then, an admin girl
        never knows when her boss is going to put his hands on her.  I know MY boss
        does-- and I really, really don't like it!  What else?

      Text: Fine.  Yes, I did.  I made an appointment with an employment lawyer and
        told her what was going on.  I was hoping she'd represent me and help me
        stop the harassment!  It took all my courage to even go to her office.  But
        as soon as she asked if I had signed the waiver voluntarily, I knew I had
        made a mistake.  Then she asked for a retainer and I just slunk out.  Like
        I had any money for that!

        my place- when I wasn't home!  I had to give him a spare house key because
        of some new HR policy.  The next thing I knew, I'd get home from work and
        find someone had rifled through my things-- ALL my things.  What could I
