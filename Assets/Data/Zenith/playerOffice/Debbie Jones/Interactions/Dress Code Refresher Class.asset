      Text: 'I mean I''m going to call Ms. Kelly in Compliance and schedule you for
        Dress Code Re-certification classes.  Six hours over the next few weeks reviewing
        the policy and workshopping wardrobe situations with Ms. Kelly.  Perhaps
        that will protect you from future temptations to flaunt the dress code. 
        Understood?   '
