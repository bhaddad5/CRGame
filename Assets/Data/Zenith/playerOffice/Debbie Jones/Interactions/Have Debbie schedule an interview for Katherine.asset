      Text: Debbie, I know I asked you once to have your sister come in for a job
        interview.  As I recall, you were very insistent that you didn't think that
        was a good idea.  Do you remember?

      Text: No, it won't.  I think ever since you were our little test subject for
        AGATHA, you've become a great deal more cooperative.  I'm going to ask you
        again- call your sister Katherine about a job opportunity here at Artemis.

      Text: Save your excuses, Debbie.  Just do what you need to do to get her in
        here.  I'm sure once she considers my offer, she'll be more than happy to
        take on a new role her at Artemis.
