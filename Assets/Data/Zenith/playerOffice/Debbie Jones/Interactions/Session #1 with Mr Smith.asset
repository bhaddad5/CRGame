        of some legal settlement.  It's funny-- there was talk of him working for
        me then.  No one thought he'd complete the MTP-- isn't that crazy?  I was
        just weeks away from completing the program.  That's when things started
        to go not so great for me.

        role by Mr. {LastName}.  That must have been a shock-- your credentials seem
        impeccable!  High GPA right through High School, then State University and
        Forbes Business School.  May I ask why you remained at Artemis when you clearly
        are qualified for an executive level role somewhere else?
