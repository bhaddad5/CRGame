        swing by your place froom time to time.  She was climbing out a window and
        he thought it all looked suspicious so he brought her in and gave me a call. 
        It looks like she was running away from home.

      Text: Obviously, this is a domestic issue.  May I make a suggestion?  In case
        this happens again, you might want to have her chipped.  We've started doing
        this with parolees, instead of the old ankle monitors.  It allows us to pick
        up runners pretty easily.  Pry Medical handles it for us.  Maybe talk to
        them?
