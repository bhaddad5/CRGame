        and your calendar is pretty packed.  Shall I have her come back at a more

        girlfriend for Debbie.  This solves a headache for me-- Tracey's been resentful
        of Debbie for quite some time.  This will make everyone very happy, except,
        I suspect, Debbie.  Are you excited?  I know you've always been attracted
        to her.

        Debbie can be your sidechick.  And you should know I intend to continue enjoying
        her myself-- they'll be no changes there.  Your little lesbian romance will
        always take a back seat to my requirements.  I hope that's taken as a given,
        Lexi.

        you.  It doesn't work that way.  You'll have to earn your prize, Lexi.  Show
