        back!  How was your trip to Katanga?  You know I've been thinking that it
        might be really convenient for you to have me with you there!  I could be
        a great asset, Mr. {LastName}!

        won't be able to withstand the demands of women stimulated by good old Hornical!

        don't want Katangan women affected?  I'll need to do some gene marker work.

      Text: Well, I can isolate Whitangan genetic markers but then there's the maturity
        issue.  I can tie it to hormonal levels but you'll still have some precocious

        MILF types.  But I'll assume those are acceptable boundaries?
