        overhear you chatting with one of the secretaries in the Break Room.  Did
        I actually hear you refer to yourself as my ''work wife''?  Could you have
        actually said that-- to another Office Girl?  '

      Text: Debbie, you know I'm a married man.  I have a wife.  You are not my wife--
        you are my secretary.  When you make such comparisons, you vastly exaggerate
        your own importance.  It is also incredibly insulting to my real wife.  You
        will NEVER refer to yourself that way again.  Do you understand?
