      Text: Here's what we're going to do.  YOU will consult your doctor and get
        a perscription for something that will put you in a better mood for this
        time of the month.  Have the doctor call me so they can broef me on your
        particulars.  And then, we may as well share our learnings.  I'm sure other
        managers are tired of their underlings behaving like sulky little girls every
        monh!
