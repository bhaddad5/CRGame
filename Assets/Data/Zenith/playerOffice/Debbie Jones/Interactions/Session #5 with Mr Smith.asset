        it was really about, I asked to get out of it but Mr. {LastName} just laughed. 
        He said if I complained again, he'd have me labeled as a homophobe and I'd
        be forced to take even more training until I passed.  I gave in-- but I never
        liked it.

        for the training, which had zero to do with tolerance!  In order to pass
        Diversity Training, you have to perform with another girl.  Sexually.  To
        demonstrate you were 'supportive and tolerant' of lesbians.  Mr. {LastName}
        had me assigned with Susan Granger, my old boss.  It was...awkward.
