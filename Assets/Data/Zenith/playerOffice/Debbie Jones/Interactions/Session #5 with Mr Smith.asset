        it was really about, I asked to get out of it but Mr. {LastName} just laughed. 
        He said if I complained again, he'd have me labelled as a homophobe and I'd
        be forced to take even more training until I passed.  I gave in-- but I never
        liked it.

      Text: I didn't like what it involved and I certainly didn't like the reason
        for the training, which had zero to do with tolerance!  In order to pass
        Diversity Training, you have to perform with another girl.  Sexually.  To
        demonstrate you were 'supportive and tolerant' of lesbians.  Mr. {LastName}
        had me assigned with Susan Granger, my old boss.  It was... awkward.

        get ten demerits?  Every demerit is a half day's pay.  When I started as

        kept getting docked.  The deductions were killing me!  So when Mr. {LastName}
        offered me an alternative, well, I took it.  I guess that makes me a real

        administers corporal correction in exchange for erasing some of my accumulated

        it is the paddle.. or the cane or even his belt, if I've really crossed the
