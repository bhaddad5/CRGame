      Text: She is.  She's been living off her advance but it doesn't look like she'll
        be doing any more work for The Business.  Mr. {LastName}, she was just trying
        to earn a living.  If anyone's to blame for what happened, it's me-- not
        Elizabeth.  Can't you just please... forget the whole thing?

        very foolish to trust your best friend but you've already been punished. 
        Call her and let's get it over with.  I wish to see her in my office.

      Text: Then she shouldn't have been such a nosey parker, Debbie.  As I'm pretty
        sure she WILL appear when summoned.  Jackson's informed me she's been served
        with a summons and we're bringing suit against her for libel.  If she wishes
        to 'work things out', I'm pretty confident she'll be willing to meet with
        me.
