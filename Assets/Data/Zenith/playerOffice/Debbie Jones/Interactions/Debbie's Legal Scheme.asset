      Text: Pretty sure.  Girls know these things.  And I think because Isabelle
        is closer in age to him than Valerie, she's more attractive to him in some
        ways.  I don't know-- I don't always understand why men like some girls and
        not others.  It can be frustrating.  Anyway, I bet Mr. Perkins would love
        adding Isabelle to his department.

      Text: Valerie is very protective of her neice but if it comes to job security,
        I think I can persuade her to 'manage' Isabelle into the business.  As far
        as skills, well... I'm sure Mr. Perkins would be happy to train her personally. 
        I think Mr. Perkins would like the idea of having an aunt and her niece reporting
        to him.

        give Jackson a new teen office toy- as well as getting him to keep Valerie

      Text: Sure- he'll really like having both of them.  Even if he IS tired of
        Val, he won't be tired of Val and Isabelle... together.  Val's shelf life
        increases if she's part of a package deal.  And then you can tell him you
        had me organize the whole thing for him- because you value his contributions
        so much.
