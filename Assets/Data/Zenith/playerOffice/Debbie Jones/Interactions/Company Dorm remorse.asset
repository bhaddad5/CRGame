      Text: Mr. {LastName}-- I thought you said the company dorm was subsidized! 
        I just got my paycheck and there's hardly any savings at all because of these
        'corporate housing' deductions!

      Text: Debbie, 'subsidized' doesn't mean it is free!  Of course, you're expected
        to contribute a portion of your salary to cover housing.  What were you thinking? 
        Anyway, how are you finding dormitory living?  I understand it has filled
        up nicely with lots of admin girls!

        making your level of income would definitely require a co-signature on any
        kind of lease these days.  And before you ask, no, Debbie-- I won't co-sign
        any lease.  You haven't shown yourself to be the most responsible girl when
        it comes to personal finance!
