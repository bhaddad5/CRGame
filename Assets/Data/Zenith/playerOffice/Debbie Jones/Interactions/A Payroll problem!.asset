        with my paycheck!  It looks like Payroll has goofed or something!  My demerit
        balance shouldn't have put this much of a dent in it!

      Text: Well, no.  It's not a mistake.  I assume our Holistic Payscale has gone
        into effect.  That deduction isn't for demerits, Debbie.  Under the new schedule,
        girls with B cups are considered 'subpar' and therefore earn a penalty. 
        Sorry about that!
