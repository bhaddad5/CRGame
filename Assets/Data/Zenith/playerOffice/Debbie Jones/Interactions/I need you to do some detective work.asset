        ever elected!  She's incredible!  She was only thirty two when she took office
        as the leader of the Social Progress Party.  I can't believe you've never
        heard of her!

      Text: She's a political rock star!  She had an all female cabinet and made
        gender equity the law in Nordlund.  She got Nordlund to vote to end their
        policy of neutrality and finally apply to join the European Alliance.  She's
        kind of a personal hero of mine-- she's inspired a lot of women to get involved
        in politics!
