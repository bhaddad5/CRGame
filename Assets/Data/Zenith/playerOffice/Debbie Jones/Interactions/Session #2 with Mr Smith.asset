        nailed down.  But whenever it looked like it might go to the next interview,
        my NEI Profile caught up with me.  Either that or an unofficial call to Mr.
        {LastName}'s office or Jada Baxter to 'check employment details' and the
        process stopped dead in its tracks.  Plus, my new hours made it hard to schedule
        interviews.
