      Text: Debbie, this will be our last session together.  So far, I'm able to
        report 100% cooperation to Mr. {LastName}.  I very much doubt you have any
        demerits to worry about!  I'd like to ask just a few more personal questions. 
        Let's start with your current personal goal.  What do you hope to achieve
        professionally in the next three years?

      Text: Well, I've finally given up trying to get an executive job.  There's
        just no point any more.  Even trying to get another admin job somewhere else
        is pointless-- no one wants an over educated secretary with an MBA, right? 
        So I'm going to work hard to impress Mr. {LastName}.  I'm currently a Secretary
        but there's no reason I can't shoot for Senior Secretary within the next
        twelve months!

      Text: I'm not stopping there, Mr. Smith!  I think once I hit Senior Secy, I
        can start working towards becoming a Personal Assistant!  Now that's a whole
        level up for an Admin girl.  There's even a wardrobe allowance for the classier
        clothes an EA is expected to wear.  After that, Executive Personal Assistant--
        that would be the most senior admin position in the whole company, except
        for Office Manager.
