        magazines-- and it would put your talents to work for us, as opposed to against
        us.  We have a very dynamic new manager in Government Affairs.  I''m sure

        sort of envied Deborah's corporate security-- before I found out she was
        just a secretary, of course.  It would be a public relations writing job,
        right?
