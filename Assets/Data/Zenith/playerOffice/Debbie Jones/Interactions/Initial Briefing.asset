        and when I'd like my coffee!  The office kitchen is nothing special but it
        is sufficient to allow you to prepare a decent cup of coffee for me.

        I'm not about to have everyone in the office gawk at me while I fix your
        coffee every day like some mousy little secretary.  That's not my job!

      Text: Very well.  I thought you might react this way to a very simple request. 
        For every day my coffee isn't on my desk, made the way I like and served
        by you-- with a smile-- they'll be a demerit.  You remember demerits?  We
        discussed them in your onboarding.

      Text: This will be the first step in her training and, because Debbie is a
        bright girl, she's put her finger right on what is making her so angry about
        this simple request.  The whole point of the public daily ritual is to remind
        the rest of the office what she is- your secretary.  It is a battle you must
        win if you're to show what kind of a manager you are.
