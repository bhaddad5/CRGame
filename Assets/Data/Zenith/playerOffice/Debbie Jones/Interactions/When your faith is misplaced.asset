        your old job again?  Be honest- you were a real Director there for a hot

      Text: I won't lie.  I miss it-- miss my old clothes and...  But it isn't just
        that.  I thought Anna Sarin was different.  Did you know she shut down her
        NGO?  And then ther's that.  I can't beieve she'd ever lower herself to pose
        for that kind fo a magazine.  She's destroying her reputation as a progressive
        feminist.

        refresh my coffee, then sit on my lap, and we'll take a look at Anna's latest. 
        And Debbie- let's have a smile, ok?  Remember- you're back on Probation. 
        It would be a shame to earn a demerit for being a Miss Frowny Face!

      Text: ...going for a 'new look'-- or being directed to do so.  For a former
        Prime Minister of Nordlund to pose for a shoot in the Russian magazine is
        not only shocking, it is most humiliating for the proud little nation's own
        reputation!  Still, is is still only pin-up material.
