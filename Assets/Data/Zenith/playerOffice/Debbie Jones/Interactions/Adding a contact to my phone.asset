      Text: Um, Mr. {LastName}, there's something wrong with this new company phone
        I've been issued.  I've tried to access websites that I know should work
        but it says 'denied access'.  And when I try to make calls, they don't go
        through.  Can I swap it out with a new one from IT?

      Text: My understanding is that the phone is subject to corporate internet guidelines. 
        It won't permit access to unauthorized content.  You'll have to argue it
        with IT-- good luck with that!  As for the phone calls, you're only allowed
        to use the phone to call approved contacts.  Who is it you wish to speak
        with?

        He's been transferred to the Washington DC office to work in their Government
        Affairs practice because he's one of their best attorneys.  It's a very big
        assignment.

        for him to get away right now.  I  get it-- it's a major opportunity for

        to him.
