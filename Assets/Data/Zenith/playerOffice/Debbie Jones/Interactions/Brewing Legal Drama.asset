      Text: So you've been giving her tips on how to give a better blowjob or something? 
        Anyway, why should I care?  If Jackson wants a new girl, he's entitled to
        get one.  If she's a good girl, maybe she'll just get dumped into the SecPool. 
        If not, Pussywillows may be hiring.  Why are you bothering me with all this
        minutiae?  Is Valerie Lyon your friend?

      Text: No, Sir.  I could care less about Val.  I'm thinking of your interests. 
        You'll need a good, smart, loyal attorney going forward.  A good lawyer is
        essential for the future.

        I want to keep him happy.
