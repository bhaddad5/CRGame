        you want to fuck her and yet after all this time, she's still out of reach,

      Text: VP of Government Affairs.  It pays five times what you're making at the
        DA's office, plus there would be a generous bonus scheme, a company car and

        Debbie.  One recruited specifically to your specifications.  Want an inexperienced
        virgin right out of high school?  Perhaps a college girl?  Or if you like,
        an older girl, maybe an unemployed executive you can train yourself.
