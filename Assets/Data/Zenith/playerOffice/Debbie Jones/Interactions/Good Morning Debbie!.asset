      Text: Yes, thank you {FirstName}.  I received the full Admin Dress Code Guidelines
        from Compliance.  As you know, I had a discussion with Ms. Kelly about a
        more appropriate wardrobe.  She was very helpful in suggesting what types
        of outfits might suit me better.

        but I don't believe pants are included in the Juniors Casual Business Dress
        Code.  So, skirts and dresses for you from now on, I think?

        realized the company was so\u2026 prescriptive when it came to Admin wardrobe. 
        The girl at the shop was helpful.  She seemed to know what clothes would
        pass muster and what wouldn't."
