        got you all hot and bothered anyway?  Are you having boy trouble with Eugene

        as far as I'm concerned but... I think he's getting kind of frustrated with
        me.  These Admin dating guidelines Jada gave me are so restrictive, Mr. {FirstName}. 
        Can't we... bend them a little bit for poor Eugene?

        I can't let things ever go too far, if you see what I'm saying.  I was hoping
        I might be allowed to do for Eugene what I do for you almost every day here
        at the office.  I bet he'd like it a lot.  Would that be ok, Mr. {LastName}?

        You're Executive Privilege, Debbie.  You knew that before this all started. 
        Now, you two can hold hands, kiss and I don't even mind if he feels you up. 
        I'm sure that's plenty enough excitement for you two kids.

      Text: Debbie, your holes are company property.  My final answer is no and now
        I'll have to schedule you for snap polygraphs at Pry to make sure you're
        not offering up unauthorized oral sex on the side.  Look, what did you do
        for your highschool boyfriends?  Don't you have any female tricks to boast
        of?
