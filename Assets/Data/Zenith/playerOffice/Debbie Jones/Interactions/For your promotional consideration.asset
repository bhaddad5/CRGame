      Text: Debbie, you're an adequate office fuck and a competent secretary- no
        more.  You're getting above yourself, young lady.  But as your superior,
        I suppose I should encourage this newly rekindled ambition.  I'm assuming
        you've given up any hopes of returning to the executive ranks?

        Assistant is one you''d have to really earn.  A Personal Assistant is a lot
