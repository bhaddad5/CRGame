      Text: It hardly compares to my previous office, but it will do.  Zenith is
        considerably warmer than Nordlund-- I'm enjoying your weather.  No, I'm here
        because I'm going to need those resources you mentioned in our last meeting. 
        I need someone who knows the company intimately and can help ferret out the
        problems.  Deborah Jones seems quite knowledgeable.

        send a message hard to ignore.  No, I'd like you to second Deborah to my
        new group.  I've had long converastions with her.  It is clear that she's
        deserving of a far more crucial role that answering your phone and serving
        you coffee.  I wish to make a temporary appointment.

      Text: Are you serious about embracing DEI values?  If so, you will have no
        objections to my appointing Deborah as Director of Planning- on a temporary
        basis to start.  In that position, she can help add some corporate weight
        to my efforts.  I've already mentioned this to my friends in international
        finance and they are MOST supportive.  I think your share price may even
        rise as a result.
