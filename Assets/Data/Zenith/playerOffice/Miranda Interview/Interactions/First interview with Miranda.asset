        isn't she?  I'd never have believed it until I heard the news-- but even
        still...  She looks so different.  She used to be so conservative and modest.

      Text: 'I''m afraid Debbie''s aspirations were always wildly out of synch with
        reality.  When we first met, she hugely overestimated her own abilities. 
        Not any more.  As for the way she dresses, what can I say?  You know girls
        like this- she''s not very good at her job so she... compensates in other
        ways.    '

        pretty surprised when she called and asked me if I was interested in the

      Text: Good old State U!  Yep, we were-- but only half a semester.  She started
        accusing me of all kinds of crazy stuff when it was obvious she was just
        jealous because I was more popular than she was.  It wasn't my fault-- she
        was so boooring.  And she judged me constantly.  So I was shocked when she
        called.

      Text: You must understand Debbie doesn't make very much.  The Referral Bonus
        seemed to really motivate her when I asked her if she knew anyone talented
        enough for this new role.  She immediately mentioned you!  So she probably
        is still jealous of your success.  Given her own status, that makes sense. 
        But she also wanted the $50 gift card too!

      Text: It makes sense now.  Anyway, enough about Deborah-- I mean Debbie.  That's
        a much better name for her, by the way.  Debbie Downer-- that's what I always
        called her behind her back.
