      Text: Tracey, you're all that BUT you are also just another female.  You require
        male control, lest your emotions run wild.  You'll get used to your new chastity
        belt-- and if you're a good girl and show me you're really trying hard in
        school, I'll allow you the occasional reward out of your belt.

        be for some time.  Until then she can either focus on her studies or continue
        to pout.
