        is quite cute but she''s very submissive.  Debbie would have the upper hand
        and that simply won''t do.  Then there''s Jayme''s ex wife Lesley, the Dykon. 
        Very dominant, which Debbie needs but she''s also a snake.  She might use
        Debbie in her own schemes. so I''d rule her out. '
