      Text: Dearest, Mackenzie needs to learn how things work around here.  I sense
        she's a very independent girl whose former mother spoiled, indulged or most
        likely ignored.  She needs much more oversight if she's to be a foster daughter
        that meets your standards.

        You'll come to me with Mackenzie's latest naughtiness and I'll correct her,
        if I think she deserves it, myself.
