        out the timing, the details...  And she must have known when you weren't
        watching her-- which is your most important responsibility.  Just keeping
        her caged here on the estate is no answer either.

      Text: Darling, perhaps she should go back to school?  I'm not really much of
        a teacher and the home schooling just hasn't worked out.  She's a young girl
        who needs socialization.  She needs to be around girls her own age.  She
        obviously resents me.  Perhaps she needs to go back to school.
