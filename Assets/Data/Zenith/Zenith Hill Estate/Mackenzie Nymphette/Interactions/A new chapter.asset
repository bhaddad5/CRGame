      Text: We won't discuss your little attempt to run away from home.  I'll simply
        remind you that any future attempt will end in even greater failure-- and
        a significantly harsher punishment.  Trust me- any attempt to repeat that
        stunt is one you'll regret dearly.

      Text: That will be enough.  As for touching you, until your attitude changes,
        don't expect any affection from me.  Perhaps when you develop a more respectful
        attitude...  Until then, you simply don't hold any interest for me whatsoever.
