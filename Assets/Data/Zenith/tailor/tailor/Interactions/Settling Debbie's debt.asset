      Text: Mr. Bannerjee, I'm sorry for this little drama involving my secretary. 
        She had some absurd idea that she was going to be a businesswoman of some
        sort and she was egged on by a woman who clearly was a bad influence on her.

      Text: Good luck with that!  Debbie's credit rating is zero.  She's never got
        more than fifty bucks in her savings account and she's barely hanging on
        to her job as it is.  You can't get blood from a stone, Bannerjee.  But because
        I don't want my office associated with any kind of scandal, I'm willing to
        pay for Debbie's suits.
