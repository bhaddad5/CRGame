        Talent and she evidently represents this girl you asked about.  She's waiting

        in the Jenkins girls for some corporate sponsorship?  They'd be perfect-
        a mother daughter team that really fits the Artemis brand.  I've been thinkign
        about some ideas--

      Text: Well, Jo Beth became a star because of Brenda Jenkin's turn on 'Stage
        Mom'!  Sure, Jo Beth took off from there, but Brenda's got a following of
        her own.  Plus, she manages Jo Beth's career so I'd advise you to consider
        them a package deal.  It will just be easier to nut out a proper contract. 
        I have a draft we might want to go over--
