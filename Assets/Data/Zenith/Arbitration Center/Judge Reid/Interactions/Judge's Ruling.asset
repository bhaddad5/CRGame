      Text: 'I''m prepared to issue a ruling on the matter of the Commission for
        Gender Quity versus Artemis Solutions Systems.  Before I do so, I must say
        after a review of the initial complaint, I anticipated a certain outcome. 
        Gender equity is crucial to our society.  '

        that the Commission's complaint has no merit.  I rule in favor of the defendant,
        Artemis Solution Systems.

        record of these hearings to the General Administration's Inspector General's
        Office, with a recommendation to review CGE protocols.  Ms. Baron-Cohen,
        you have placed your commission in potentially danerous waters.

        your defence?  Do you know how much this entire affair will discredit the
        very body you werre appointed to lead?  Because of some vendetta you had
        against someone who had bested you in some corporate power struggle?

      Text: Your Honor, we respect the Commission and their work too much to besmirch
        it, just because a couple of bad apples were up to no good.  We're happy
        to seal the records of this hearing and seek reconciliation with the CGE
        outside the arbitration process.  There's no further need to waste your valuable
        time.

        to seal the records.  As far as teh public knows, this arbitration never
        happened.  And Ms. Tremont and Ms. Baron-Cohen, if I hear of any more of
        this kind of bureacratic malfeasence, I will--
