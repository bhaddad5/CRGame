      Text: Did you see what Jada discovered?  A virgin!  That's be a modest reward
        for all your hard work, wouldn't it?  And what a thrill for her too-- to
        be deflowered by the Chairman himself!  We'd stick her in the Sec Pool and
        I bet once word got out that you'd popped her cherry, she'd have lots of
        execs requesting her 'services'!

        to the company.  How could we use this to raise the morale around here?

      Text: Well, we could do a lottery or make her the prize in a competition? 
        Perhaps we should brainstorm with the Senior Management team?  I'd hate to
        be accused of squirreling away the spare virgins for myself!

      Text: Good idea.  I'll have Debbie send out invitations and we'll hash it out
        with the rest of the boys!  But first I ought to see this little intern for

      Text: She's currently assigned to Purchasing.  Why not take a walk over?  There's
        finally something interesting to look at in that department instead of that
        walking headache Lisa Merchant.
