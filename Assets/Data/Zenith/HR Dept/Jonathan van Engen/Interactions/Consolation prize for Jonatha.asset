        you two get together.  I think you like what you see--- she''s your preferred
        flavor, if you know what I mean.  She says she''s a college student.  I ''donate''
        a couple hundred bucks towards her tuition every time I visit.  She''s not
        a pro but she is a VERY talented amateur.  '

        up in a new apartment and that soon she may no longer be slinging drinks

        a lot less sassy, but her boss couldn''t be happier or more grateful to you.
