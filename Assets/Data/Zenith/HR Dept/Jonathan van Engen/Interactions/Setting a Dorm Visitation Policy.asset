        I'm sure you heard about it.  The question is, what do we do about it?  We
        clearly need some boundaries put in place.  What limits would you place on
        dorm visitation?  Carole?

      Text: Mr. van Engen, my understanding is that the girls enjoy receiving visitors,
        especially from executives or their bosses.  It's a huge opportunity for
        them really!  And with the girls all secured, there's a natural tendency
        for them to want to earn a little respite.  So, in general, I'd go for a
        more liberal visitation policy.

      Text: I'd set Visiting Hours and perhaps set up Hospitality Suites that could
        be booked by executives in advance.  I'd allow girls to be logged out during
        Visiting Hours, allowing them to leave the SecDorm under the care of the
        excutive.  It would be great for the morale of both the girls and our Executive
        Team!

        don't you want your young studs to have something to work towards?  No, I'd

        have to squeeze themselves into the shoeboxes these girls live in.  Build
        some luxury suites that the bosses can book so when they visit their secretary,
        they can stretch out and enjoy themselves.
