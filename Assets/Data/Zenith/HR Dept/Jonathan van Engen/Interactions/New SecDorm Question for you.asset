      Text: I've reviewed the plans for the new dormitory supplied by the Planning
        girl.  She's quite good-- the quarters are tight but it is all under budget. 
        It should accommodate all the office girlies we'd ever want to jam in there. 
        I do have a concern though.

        it isn't awful and we'll have plenty of security.  What's your concern?

        death, but still...  no, I wouldn't risk putting a male manager in a snake
        pit filled with horny, ambitious office girls like that.  We need a female-
        a Dormitory Matron to crack the whip, one the bitches won't be able to distract.

      Text: No.  I'm selfish and I keep them busy enough in my personal time.  I'd
        say Candy Kelly but she has family responsibilities.  I was thinking of the
        girl in Purchasing- Lisa Merchant.  She's organzied, conscientious and reliable-
        perfect for keeping the din of the new hen house down to a dull roar.

      Text: Lisa?  Why not?  My only concern then would be losing her in Purchasing. 
        It is a dead end role for any decent manager but she seems to thrive on petty
        details and paperwork.

      Text: Which is precisely why I think she'd make an ideal Dorm Mother.  But
        why would it have to be one or the other?  There's no reason she shouldn't
        be expected to handle both roles.  And if you frame the offer the right way,
        it wouldn't cost the company one dollar more for her to take on a whole new
        job in addition to her position in Purchasing.

      Text: Simple- she either moves in and assumes the Dorm Matron role or she's
        unemployed.  Simple- overworked or out of work.  We can assign her a bigger
        single room, little privileges at the dorm and so forther but nothing that
        will cost us any money.  She'll moan a bit but she'll agree.  What choice
        does she have?  Besides, I think she'll secretly love her new authority. 
        All these girls do.
