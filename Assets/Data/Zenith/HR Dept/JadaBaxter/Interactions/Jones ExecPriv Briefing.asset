        be dating again.  I was under the impression that this 'ExecPriv' thing was
        more of an internal and informal thing.  Is a review of this really necessary?

        that a petty distinction but we know better, don't we?  You wouldn't wnat

      Text: Typical.  You've always thought you were far more important than you
        are.  Now, ExecPriv is a real thing.  Your public conduct reflects the company
        and it resticts and controls social contacts that could damage our corporate
        reputation.  So, yes, ExecPriv does determine who and what you're allowed
        to do in your 'private' sphere.

        Most managers don't so it suggests he has a great deal of trust in you. 
        Of course, you'll still need to request a signed Social Activity Permission
        Form from him for these dates.  Understand, Debbie?
