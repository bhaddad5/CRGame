        over achiever, you must not have heard about her forecast presentation fiasco
        in front of Ms. Bledsoe.  Which is why I've updated her profile on the National
        Employers Index.  I'm afraid it isn't a very positive review of her work.

        she'd have pursuing a new job.  The NEI Profiles are accessed by every major
        corporation.  A poor review would prevent her from even getting an interview,
        let alone a job offer.

        presentation.  Wow-- what a disaster that was!  Director Bledsoe even spoke
