      Text: 'So glad you dropped by!  It seems one of your direct reports isn''t
        happy with duties required in her new positions.  Deborah Jones has filed
        an official complaint advising that you requested her to make coffee for
        you.  Miss Management Trainee No More was quite distressed over the whole
        thing. '

        any case, who does she think she is anyway?  Don't worry about it.  I just
        thought you'd like to know.

      Text: No, I don't.  She's a self entitled bitch who treated me pretty poorly
        when she thought she was moving up the ladder.  As for this place, I like
        the job but the rest is...   Well, from one outsider to another, I think
        you know what I really think of this company and the hypocrisy that fills
        it up like some hot air balloon.  You do know Jones is going to be an ongoing
        issue, right?

      Text: I doubt you'll have the chance.  Your NEI Profile won't block her forever,
        you know.  But if you do want to hold on to her, I could be of assistance. 
        We HR types are positioned in companies all over town and we have a kind
        of underground network.  If I put the word out, I'll know if and when Deborah
        Jones lands an interview.

      Text: That would be useful information to know.  Who she's interviewing with
        and for what position.  And any... feedback you might have to share with
        your colleagues at the hiring companies.  I'd be most appreciative of that
        kind of help.
