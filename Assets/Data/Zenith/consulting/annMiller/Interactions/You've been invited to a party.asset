        Not to the wedding of course-- that wouldn't be appropriate.  But at another
        event-- as a kind of surprise guest.

        the entertainment-- for the Bachelor Party.  Donald's Best Man thought you'd
        make an excellent little present before he ties the knot-- and I thought
        it was a splendid idea.  It isn't like you don't fuck to do your day job. 
        You'd be earning $100 as well.

      Text: Anne, I wasn't asking.  You'll perform or you'll find yourself unemployed--
        and unemployable.  You know I have that power.  You'll be given the details
        and if I hear that you've failed to perform as Donald wishes, you will find
        your career over and your prospects deader than Julius Ceasar.  Do we understand
        one another?
