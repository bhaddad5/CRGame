      Text: Alright-- fill out the security clearances.  You'll still need to get
        Anne's buy in.  Ask her if you can tag along on some sales calls with smaller
        clients first though.  When Anne thinks you're ready for Titan, she'll let
        you know.  Good luck!

        joint sales calls before Anne will even consider bringing you out to Titan! 
        It is a major mission, but worth if when you manage to crack the Titan account!'
