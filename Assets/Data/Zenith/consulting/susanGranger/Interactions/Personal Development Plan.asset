      Text: Congratulations, {FirstName}.  I've recommended you be promoted to Executive-
        probationary to start, but still-- well done.  You've come a long way in
        a short period of time.  Frankly, you've exceeded my own expectations.  We
        need to develop a PDP for you.

        to take on Manager responsibilities.  It doesn't guarantee you'll reach that
        level, but if you hope to be considered for a Manager role here, you need
        to complete PDP training.  We should use Deborah's as a guide.

        you'll need to complete.  Once you do, I'll sign off on your eligibility

        up any high expectations though.  Spots don't open up that often, ok?
