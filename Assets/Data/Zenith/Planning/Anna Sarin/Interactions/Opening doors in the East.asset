      Text: No.  Actually, I was hoping you might be willing to expand your work
        here by providing much needed guidance on a new market I've always hoped
        we might move into.  As a former Head of Government, your foreign policy
        experience is invaluable and far surpasses my own understanding of such things.

      Text: It's quite true.  As Prime Minister of Nordlund, I had to navigate very
        dangerous waters.  It has become a particularly unsettled part of the world
        recently.  But statescraft was certainly an essential requirement of my role
        as PM and I have many contacts around the globe.  What market are you interested
        in penetrating?

        Nordlund used to be an unwilling  province of Russia.  When we finally broke
        away, the price was strict neutrality.  Nordlund was forced to walk a delicate
        line.  Despite natural affinity with the West, we had no choice but to informally
        follow Russian direction in our foreign policy.

      Text: Most Russians would disagree-- although many Russian women have reached
        out to me with words of support.  They would often lament their was no Russian
        Anna Sarin for them to rally aorund!  You see I campaigned on disrupting
        the status quo and aligning Nordlund with the West and a break with our traditional
        neutrality.  Russia was NOT happy with my decision!

      Text: No-- but Nordlund, certainly.  I know it isn't the biggest market, but
        it would be easy enough for me to introduce an Artemis corporate presence
        there.  Perhaps we might focus on that for a start.  Of course, I'd be choosing
        the most appropriate local business partners?
