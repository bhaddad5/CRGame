        thousand hardly breaks the bank.  That this talented young woman was ever
        reduced to the role of a mere secretary-- it's clear I have a lot of work
        to do here at Artemis!  Not to speak of the ridiculous dress code you assigned
        her-- I've given her a personal loan to address that immediately!

        for a possible unit over there.

        to give notice before she can just vacate-- two months I believe.  It's on
        the company agreement she signed-- and there's nothing even a Board member
        can do about that.
