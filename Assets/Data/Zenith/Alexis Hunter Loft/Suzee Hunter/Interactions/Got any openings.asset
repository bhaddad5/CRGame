      Text: Hey, Suzee!  You're looking good!  It seems stripping agrees with you! 
        I'll need to drop by and catch your act-- maybe slip a bill in your g string. 
        My old boss at Artemis- now stripping at Artemis.  Life sure is strange,
        isn't it Suzee?

      Text: Yeah, crazy!  Hey, I was wondering if you had any openings at Artemis. 
        Stripping is a lot of work and I don't just strip any more.  I offer things
        on the side now and it's...  I know there's a rule about married couples
        working together but I could always go back to my maiden name.  Is there
        anything?

      Text: It's not that much- not as much as an office job would pay.  I'd take
        an admin job, Mr. {LastName}.  Maybe a new manager who likes blondes?  Plus
        I could dance for him!

      Text: And even more I'm guessing.  No-- nothing at the moment.  And I'm not
        sure we really want to start hiring girls off the street.  We do have standards,
        Suzee.  But if anything changes, I'll let you know.  See you at the club,
        Suzee.  Don't suck too many strange cocks, ok?
