        actually.  She's already applied to go out on a date with a legislative aide
        she's been communicating with.  It appears he wants to take Elizabeth here
        out on a date?

        did either one of you any favors.  She got her hopes raised and your time
        was wasted.  So you're showing better judgement than I have exercising Executive
        Privilege.  Anyway, there's some paperwork that's missing.
