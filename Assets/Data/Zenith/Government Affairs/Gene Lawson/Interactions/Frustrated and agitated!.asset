      Text: Oh, of course!  If anything, I blame Debbie now.  She never told me she
        was belted-- it was damn selfish of her too.  It didn't make any sense at
        the time-- I knew she was horny as hell but she played the Ice Princess act
        to the end.  And ever since Elizabeth's been fitted, she's been acting nutty.
