        real thing-- even though I know Elizabeth had been dreading it.

        really bisexual-- they certainly wouldn''t like having an audience.  But
        as you could see for yourself, the Boss''s Voice is a powerful managerial
        motivator!   '

        you said was true.  I really did dodge a bullet with her.  I can do a LOT
        better than Debbie.

      Text: You always could have.  I'm pleased you finally figured that out.  Girls
        like Debbie and Elizabeth are for fun, nothing more.  Find yourself a proper,
        virtuous woman for a wife you'll be proud of.  Now that you've seen what
        Debbie's willing to do, you know that Debbie was never wife material.

        if I give Deborah and Elizabeth this little gift?  I thought it would be
        a nice reminder of their new interdepartmental relationship.
