      Text: Good!  Don't disregard her ideas though.  She's a bright girl so don't
        waste her.  Just have her work on the projects you think have merit, then
        slap your name on it.  She'll appreciate the chance to 'contribute' and it
        will make her feel better.  I do this with Debbie.
