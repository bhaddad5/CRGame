      Text: You can really teach Debbie a lesson when she's dressed like this!  The
        Detention Hall Collection consists of sixteen separate outfits and costs
        $10,000 USD.  If you purchase it, Debbie will wear them in rotation with
        her other approved wardrobe.  You can also always return the outfits, but
        of course we do not have a refund policy.
