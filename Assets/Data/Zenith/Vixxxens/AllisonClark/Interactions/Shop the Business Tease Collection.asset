      Text: Now that Debbie has reached the pinnacle of the Admin Girl ladder, I
        think she may be putting on airs, as if she was a kind of executive herself,
        instead of an Exec PA.  She's far too formal now and I think she needs to
        be reminded of her other duties, if you catch my meaning.

      Text: Doesn't she look hot in this?  The Business Tease Collection consists
        of twenty-six separate outfits and costs $10,000 USD.  If you purchase it,
        Debbie will wear them in rotation with her other approved wardrobe.  You
        can also always return the outfits, but of course we do not have a refund
        policy.
