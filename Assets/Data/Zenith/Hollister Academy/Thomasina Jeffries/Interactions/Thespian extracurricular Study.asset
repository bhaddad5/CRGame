      Text: Mr. {LastName}, thank you for coming today.  First, I'm pleased to say
        your wife Debbie has completed all our special activity modules.  She's a
        very special girl-- you should be quite proud!

      Text: Thank you, Miss Jeffries.  I can't say Debbie especially likes being
        here, but it does keep her days filled and, more importantly, gives me peace
        of mind that she's being looked after.

      Text: We can of course keep her in General Activities, but I thought you might
        be interested in something special for Debbie.  A new activity stream to
        keep her engaged.  Your foster daughter Mackenzie is enrolled in the Academy.

        bunny!  Having the both of them under our care prompted a thought.  We have
        quite a few pairs of girls enrolled here- sisters, aunts and nieces and mothers
        and daughters.  Sometimes their sponsors like them to receive supplemental
        training. '

        fee, we could assign Mackenzie and Debbie individualized coaching.  They''d
        be provided with scripts and costumes and would rehearse short plays to perform
        for you.  '

      Text: We have twelve scripts that have been developed.  You'd be invited to
        select the ones they focus on each week and you'd be invited backstage to
        watch their rehearsals.  And if you had any thoughts on script changes, our
        drama coaches would be happy to accommodate.  You'd have any ending you liked
        for each dramatic act.
