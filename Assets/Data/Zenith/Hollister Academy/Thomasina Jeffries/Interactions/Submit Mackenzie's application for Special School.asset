      Text: I know our process may seem a bit involved, but I feel a guardian really
        must get to know what our school offers before even discussing an application. 
        Of course, we'd be delighted to accept Mackenzie back into Hollister Academy--
        though this time in our Special School.

        for her to be during the weekday, I haven't given much thought to her future. 
        What do you propose we do with Mackenzie?

      Text: Mr. {LastName}, you are rapidly becoming a public figure.  Mackenzie's
        story is well known, as is your own role in rescuing her from a predatory
        situation.  She's a most beautiful girl and she possesses a natural charm
        and grace that seems almost exotic.

      Text: Of course!  It explains the features and coloring!  Well, for a man of
        means such as yourself, I'm suggesting Mackenzie be trained for the pageant
        world.  True, it is highly competitive.  But with rigorous training, I believe
        she could successfully compete.

      Text: We have a few Special School girls who are being trained, on instruction
        from their guardians, to compete in beauty pageants.  It is pastime that
        rewards with pride of possession and the reflected glory of possessing a
        bona fide beauty queen.  It is a perfect calling for Mackenzie-- should you
        so wish.
