      Text: It occurred to me that if Compliance isn't part of all this, my diversity
        and inclusion plans won't have much teeth.  We need to get them trained up
        as a priority!

      Text: Of course.  I was going to ask you about Compliance.  There will be an
        extra charge but I can totally get a program set up for Compliance.  We can
        even make them first cab off the rank!
