        making it happen.  Ms. Jantz is a great boss.  I'll miss journalism but for
        now, this is what I'll be doing for a living-- and I'm pretty happy about
        that.

        think Debbie has a tendency to slack off.  I want you to be firm with her--
        that's why I had you assigned as her trainer.
