      Text: Mr. {LastName}, I respectfully request that we deal with the Katie Jones
        situation.  Cigarettes, alcohol-- even drugs found in her possession-- it's
        all blatantly against Dorm Rules!

      Text: Well... I had an idea.  I've heard rumors of a certain room.  I've heard
        girls whisper about it and not in a good way.  The rumor is office girls
        considered rambunctious go in and come out in a much more subdued frame of
        mind.  Some girls call it the Bad Room.
