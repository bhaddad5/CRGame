      Text: I had hoped that the girls would review the Dormitory Rules I drafted
        and follow them as I expected they would.  I mean they are all responsible
        employees... but I'm embarrassed to say they've ignored my proposed rules
        and I'm already seeing them break them routinely.

      Text: Well, that's for me-- and yourself-- to decide!  For one infraction,
        I think Punishment Chores are appropriate.  Accumulating three should result
        in being grounded.  For five, I think a Curfew involving an early Lights
        Out would send a message.  And for more...

      Text: Well, I think six Dorm Infractions deserve a... spanking.  By yourself
        or another Manager, of course.  Maybe less if you think that's better.  I
        understand corporal correction is used in the office when enough Demerits
        stack up and... it seems appropriate here in the dorm.  That would really
        put the girls on notice!

      Text: Demerits work in the office environment.  I can see your Dorm Infractions
        working the same way.  But if you REALLY expect respect from these girls,
        you'll have to gear yourself up to delivering corporal punishment yourself,
        Lisa.
