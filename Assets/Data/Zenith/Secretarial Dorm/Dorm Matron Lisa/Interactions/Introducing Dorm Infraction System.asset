      Text: I had hoped that the girls would review the Dormitory Rules I drafted
        and follow them as I expected they would.  I mean they are all responsible
        employees... but I'm embarrassed to say they've ignored my proposed rules
        and I'm already seeing them break them routinely.

        I think Punishment Chores are appropriate.  Accumulating three should result
        in being grounded.  For five, I think a Curfew involving an early Lights
        Out would send a message.  And for more...

        or another Manager, of course!I understand corporal correction is used in
        the office when enough Demerits stack up and... it seems appropriate here
        in the dorm.  That would put the girls on notice!

      Text: Demerits work in the office environment.  I can see your Dorm Infractions
        working the same way.  But if you REALLY expect respect from these girls,
        you'll have to gear yourself up to delivring corporal punishment yourself,
        Lisa.
