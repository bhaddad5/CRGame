        after hours.  There was recently a bunch of them-- quite drunk having come
        straight from Pussywillows I gathered-- who wanted admission into the dorm. 
        Mr. {LastName}, it was three in the morning!

      Text: Well, they wanted access to the girls!  It was pretty scary!  They were
        not happy when I refused to open the security gates and even threatened me! 
        It was a very tense situaton.  And it hasn't been the only demand to gain
        access.  Company execs want to see the girls after hours and we need a policy
        that covers all this!
