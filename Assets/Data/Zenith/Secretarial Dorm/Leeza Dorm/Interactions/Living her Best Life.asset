      Text: 'I know what you''re thinking, Leeza.  That you''ll be able to get a
        new job and put all this behind you.  Ask Debbie how that worked out for
        her.  She''s got a master''s degree- just like you.  Here''s some advice. 
        Forget getting used to it-- instead, embrace it.  You''ll be happier when
        you finally accept that you''re now living your best life.  It''s as good
        as it gets for you Leeza.    '
