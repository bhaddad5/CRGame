        each pair of roomates are ranked. There is a Senior Girl and a Junior Girl. 
        This helps ensure a chain of responsibility, which is necessary to maintain
        civility and order in the dorm.  Katie, you are the Junior Girl asssigned
        to Dorm Room 237.  Debbie is the Senior Girl.
