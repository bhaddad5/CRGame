        since.  She was kind enough to make teh request on my behalf.  Your PR folks
        were kind of a brick wall, to be honest.  I had to try a work around.

        to secretary.  She was so confident after she'd earned her MBA.  But I understand. 
        I was laid off and was unemployed for awhile- until I landed this assignment. 
        It's... tough out there.  A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do, right?

        She's changed-- and not for the better I'm afraid.

      Text: Well, it is kind of both actually.  My article is about how former high
        powered female executives are now finding themselves in a career dead end. 
        It is becoming a bit of a phenomena that The Business asked me to look into. 
        Deborah seems to be a perfect example.

        I'm afraid I don't have much to say about the topic.  And I'd ask you to
        refrain from pressuring Debbie on this.  She's already very embarrassed about
        her career crash.  If you're a real friend to her, you'd let the matter rest.
