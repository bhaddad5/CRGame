      Text: '{FirstName}, before you arrived I had a look at the latest revenue numbers
        from Finance.  All I can say is... wow!  Your consultant sure stuck a poker
        up Cynthia''s ass, didn''t he?  We''re up twenty-five percent-- and the forwards
        look beautiful!'

      Text: I believe we have an opportunity to upgrade here big time.  It goes to
        show what happens when you get a real pro in place.  I hate to say it, but
        I think Artemis has outgrown Cynthia Fitzgerald.  I recommend we appoint
        a Chief Revenue Officer to oversee the Sales Department going forward.

      Text: With numbers like this, I agree.  Cynthia sold me a house-- that's how
        we met.  When Artemis was just starting up, she was fine, but now...  OK. 
        Let's recruit a CRO.  Any viable candidates come to mind?
