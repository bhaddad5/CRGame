      Text: Look, this is delicate but I'm hearing things about you and your admin. 
        I'm no prude and I'm no hypocrite, but would you mind keeping your... affairs
        a bit more discreet?  My God, {LastName}, she's barely respectable in those
        outfits she wears!

        ever dress that way for work unless she was trying to get some attention.

        crush on me- and is probably making up stories that aren't exactly true.

      Text: The one and only.  She failed out of the MTP.  It was devastating for
        her so I took her on as my secretary.  She's competent enough-- in that role
        anyway.

        God she washed out then.  What a disaster that would have been-- she's clearly
