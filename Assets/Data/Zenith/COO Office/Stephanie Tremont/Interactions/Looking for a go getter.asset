        a Forbes alumna in your office.  I'd like to offer her the job of Operations
        Manager, if you're willing to let her come over.

      Text: Deborah Jones, of course.  I understand there was some sort of problem
        with her coming out of the Management Training Program.  Somehow she wound
        up in an admin position, which is a ridiculous waste of her talent.  I'm
        a Forbes MBA too.

      Text: Debbie?  My secretary?  But she's just an admin-- you can't possibly
        mean you want to promote her to a management position!  No, I'm sorry.  As
        her direct line manager, you need my permission to recruit her internally
        and I think it would be a mistake.

        record-- that everyone knows what you''ve done to that poor woman.  What
        you''ve reduced her to.  You may think it is funny, but I don''t.  When I
