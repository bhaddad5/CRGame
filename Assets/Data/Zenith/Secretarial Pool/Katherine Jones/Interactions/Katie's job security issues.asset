      Text: Mr. {LastName}?  Katie Jones has been hoping you might consider granting
        her a request.  It seems she's become VERY concerned that you don't find

        here if that's the case and it is a quick drop to Hump Alley if she's terminated.

        hope that you might "put me to use" soon and admits she's very jealous of
