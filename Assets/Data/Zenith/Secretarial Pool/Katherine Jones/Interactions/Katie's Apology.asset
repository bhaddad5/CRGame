      Text: ...Katie begins to strip before you.  You can tell what a struggle it
        is for her, as she tries to unsuccessfully to retain her composure.  "Hurry

        face."  You don't disagree.  "Go on, Katie-- show Mr. {LastName} what you
        have to offer."

      Text: '"It would be an honor to service you!"  Lexi chuckles, her management
        style once again reaffirmed.  Katie seems as terrified of the Office Manager
