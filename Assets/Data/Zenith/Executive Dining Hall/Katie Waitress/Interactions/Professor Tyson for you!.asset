        But he probably could have gotten in on his own.  Candy's great.  I keep

        job as your Compliance Manager!

        But of course, she must obey her new husband so when you do choose to have
        her resign, I'll understand.  What about your foster daughter?

      Text: Deirdre?  She's... learning.  Trying to adapt.  But every time I think
        she's trying to behave herself, she disappoints.  That's why I've enrolled
        her into Hollister.  They have a two year Finishing School option.  Perhaps
        they can turn her into a proper little lady.
