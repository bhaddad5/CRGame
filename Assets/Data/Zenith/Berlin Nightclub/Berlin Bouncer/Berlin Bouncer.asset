  Bio: 'Berlin is only able to stay in business because the club''s bouncers enforce
    a ''No questions asked'' philosophy when dealing with customers who misbehave. 
    Their ominous presence only adds to the thrill of being admitted and also discourages
    any problems once inside the club.


    As a result, beautiful girls abound. 
    If you''re looking for a hook-up, anything can happen at Berlin-- but you have
    to pay the piper to take your shot! '
