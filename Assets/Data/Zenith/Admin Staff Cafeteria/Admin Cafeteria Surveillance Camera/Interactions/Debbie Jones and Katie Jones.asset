      Text: Gee, Big Sister- how do you think?  One of the copy machines broke down
        and a repairman came in to fix it.  You'd think he was Prince Charming the
        way the girls all swooned.  Damn, even my panties got damp.  At least the
        other girls get signed out by random execs.  But not me.  I'm under 'Executive
        Privilege'- lucky me!

        You're so ungrateful!  As for attending Mr. {LastName} when he travels, well,
        there are privileges ot rank, Little Sister!  I am the Chairman's personal
