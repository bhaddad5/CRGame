      Text: Jada, I'm so happy you're going to be one of my bridesmaids.  There's
        sort of a reason Mr. Chase wanted me to ask you.  It's kind of embarrassing
        though...

      Text: Well- ok.  You're kind of from the ghetto right?  So you probably know
        a lot more stuff about... sex than I do.  I don't-- well, didn't-- have a
        lot of experience and even now I don't know how to do a lot of... things
        that Mr. Chase would probably like me to learn.  As my bride's maid, would
        you... teach me?

        Engen and he said it was fine as long as there was video of the lessons he
