        Blair Santos is such a slut.  I have no idea what Dr. E sees in her.  She's
        so shameless-- always throwing herslf at him.  And she's just a bar girl
        basically.  Real low class.  But...

        He barely gives me the time of day.  I never thought I'd say it but I have
        this crush on him- I can't help it!  It's not like we can go on dates and
        meet new men, is it?  It's like he's bored with me and put me on a shelf--
        and there's nothing I can do!
