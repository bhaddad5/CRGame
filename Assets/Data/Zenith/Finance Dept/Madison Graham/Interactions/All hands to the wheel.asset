      Text: Madison, I know this isn't my area, but I'm concerned that Noriko may
        be getting a bit overwhelmed by the IPO.  Is there any chance you might help
        on this?

      Text: Goodness!  Of course!  It's just that Ms. Akimoto hasn't wanted me involved
        in that at all!  I'm not sure she'd appreciate me offering to help and I
        really don't want to get on her bad side.  I don't think she thinks I'm up
        to dealing with the complexities of an IPO filing.

      Text: Tell you want.  I'll divert some of the paperwork to you and when the
        time comes, I'll make sure you get full credit!  I'm sure that will give
        Noriko something to think about.  You deserve more credit that she's giving
        you-- I know that!
