      Text: Charlie, I hate to put you in the middle of a corporate throwdown but
        I've become increasingly concerned with Jen Page's meddling in Finance.

      Text: No problem, {FirstName}.  Don't worry-- I know who's really running the
        shop and it ain't Jen.  I'll feed her the basics, nothing more.  I don't
        think she understands half of what we do here anyway.
