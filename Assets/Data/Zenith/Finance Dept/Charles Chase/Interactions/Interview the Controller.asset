      Text: I understand you have extensive experience in the defence sector.  We
        do quite a bit of business there.  I would imagine there's an extra level
        of scrutiny when security clearances are involved.

      Text: You're absolutely right.  That said, you'd be surprised at what security
        classifications can hide.  One learns to be... discreet in such an environment. 
        I pride myself in my ability to go along to get along.  Life's too short,
        right?

      Text: Indeed.  We have a CFO who's absorbed by our upcoming IPO.  We need someone
        able to run Finance day to day.  We also of course need a man capable of
        stepping into the CFO role if needed.  Does this appeal to you?  It's a busy
        job-- your family time might suffer!

        top spot is why I'm here.  Would I have support in running things?

        clearly closed the deal for him.  Having a pretty young thing like Madison

        Artemis!'
