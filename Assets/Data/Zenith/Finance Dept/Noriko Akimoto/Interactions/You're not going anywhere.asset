        price below ten dollars.  We both know Artemis should go two or three times
        that number.  What does Tomo have in mind?  And why are you working against
        your own employer?

      Text: Alright.  So you know.  Tomo sent me here.  They want to gobble up Artemis
        on the cheap through fronts.  And I'm not working against my employer-- I'm
        working for them.  I never stopped working for Tomo.  They promised I could
        stay here if I sabotaged the IPO.

      Text: Do you know what it is like for a woman in corporate Japan?  I hate it
        there!  And they'll let me stay here and run Tomo USA once Artemis is bought
        up.  I can be a boss, not some corporate wife-- or worse.  What are you going
        to do?  What do you want?
