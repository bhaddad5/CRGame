      Text: Quite right!  There was a minor scandal that ended that-- Donny was fiddling
        with one of our paralegals and your Ms. Miller found out.  I got rid of the
        paralegal and Don was most grateful.  He's since found a very nice girl from
        a good family and once again., he's engaged ot be married.  He's asked me
        to be the Best Man-- an old duffer like me!  Can  you imagine?

      Text: Well as Best Man, I'm responsible for the Bachelor Party entertainment. 
        I was wondering if you might make Miss Miller available for a one last fling
        sort of performance.  I think Don will be thrilled with a surprise like that--
        don't you?  That's assuming you have your employee firmly under control and
        she'll be open to such a proposal.  She'd be paid industry rate- say, $100?
