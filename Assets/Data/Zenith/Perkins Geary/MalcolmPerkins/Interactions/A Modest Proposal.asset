      Text: 'I''ve already suggested Amber''s not the most learned attorney.  Her
        expertise, such as it was, was in commercial real estate.  She was never
        a good fit for Artemis, merely a convenient one.  Jen Page was just happy
        to have a rabid little feminist.  The problem is Artemis is a high tech firm. 
        You need a Corporate Counsel with a depth of Intellectual Property nous. 
        Amber isn''t that.    '

        as Corporate Counsel for Artemis would be a fine start to his career before
        he takes over the firm.  I''m sure he''d be fine with any enlightened policies
        you wish to put in place.  As for me, since Amber will be looking for a new
        job soon...  I may be persuaded to take her back on here.  On very different
        terms of course. '
