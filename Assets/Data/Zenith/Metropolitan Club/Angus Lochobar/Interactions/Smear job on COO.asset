        She's a tough character.  I understand why Jen's investment advisors pushed
        her appointment as COO.

      Text: Yes, she does have real corporate pedigree, unlike most of the amateurs
        over there.  Perhaps a small item in our 'Rumours' column might help, maybe
        reporting on whispers regarding her trying to by pass Page with the potential
        investors?

      Text: Jennifer Page is so defensive-- it would drive a real wedge between them. 
        You know, Angus, I think we ought to book a new campaign.  We really need
        to promote the Artemis brand more than we are!
