      Text: Dean, I was hoping I'd catch you!  Look, you know I'm always thinking
        of how to be a better friend to our illustrious Board members.  I may have
        some information that could prove of interest to an investor like yourself.

      Text: Katanga.  And it isn't second hand either.  I bought a penthouse there
        in the Hotel D'Afrique.  The location is perfect.  And listen to this- it
        has jumped in value by fifty percent since I bought it!

      Text: Katanga's booming right now.  The government seems to have the domestic
        situation well in hand and the mineral sector is going insane!  Real estate--
        yes, it would be a natural flow on.  Do you have a development contact over
        there for me?
