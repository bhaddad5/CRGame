      Text: I was thinking of when we first met and remembered how one day I was
        going to have Deborah Jones give me a lap dance in public-- for everyone
        to see how she was really putting her MBA to work.  Here's my money, MBA
        Debbie.  Lucky for you, it helps you knock off some of your outstanding debt. 
        Nice for me because I get wind up getting back-- right?
