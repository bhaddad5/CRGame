        luck and forced to shake her tits for a few bucks.  A lot of them have requested
        privates.  Debbie could be turning a LOT of tricks if you'd just give me
        the ok.

        IS my other dancers.  They don''t get the option to turn down privates and
        they resent the hell out of Debbie.   It is like she''s better than they
        are and it is causing problems.  Debbie knows she''s ''protected'' and she
        looks down on the other dancers.   '
