        she owes me.  Anyway, before I took her on as my secretary, she was an executive--
        with an MBA.  She secretly still thinks of herself as a woman way above a
        joint like this.  I actually think it might be a nice way to brand here--
        "MBA Debbie".  Do you think that angle might work? '
