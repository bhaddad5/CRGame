        a squad to use to promote our new services.  I can use them at promotional

        maybe a hundred dollars extra a month, along with their boss''s permission
        of course.  The real attraction is the opportunity to do some travel and
        perform in public.  '

        won't have any problem-- announce try outs and watch them line up in droves. 
        I'd have Debbie try out but it might seem like favoritism if she made it
        onto the squad!
