      Text: 'You may!  We actually do a lot of business with Tomo Industries.  It
        is one of the huge Japanese conglomerates that are in everything.  Anyway,
        she was sent over to negotiate a contract on their behalf.  She was a Management
        Accountant for Tomo Technology.  '

      Text: Exactly!  Same here.  It turns out she was sent over to be educated here
        since she was a teenager.  She's related to a minor branch of the Tomo family. 
        Anyway, we sort of bonded and she told me after going to school here, she
        just hated working back in Japan.
