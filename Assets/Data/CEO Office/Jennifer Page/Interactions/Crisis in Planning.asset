      Text: Yes, of course-- but in the meantime, Planning is leaderless.  It's a
        critical department.  I need someone there who can hold it all together! 
        While you'v eonly been witH Aretmis for a short time, you have demonstrated
        that kind of leadership.  I want you to take over, effective immediately.
