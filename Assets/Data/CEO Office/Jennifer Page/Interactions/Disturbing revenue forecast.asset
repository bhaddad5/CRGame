        based on data Finance provided.  I'm afraid my analysis varies pretty dramatically
        from what the Sales Department has submitted.

        so far.  What is the delta of the discrepancy from her figures and Planning's?

      Text: Almost twenty percent.  Cynthia's forecast is based on a more rosy take
        on the macro economy.  Planning disagrees-- we see stormy seas ahead and
        advise we batten down the hatches and get ready.

      Text: I see!  Twenty percent!  That will push back the IPO for at least a year! 
        This is intolerable.  If you're right, we've got a major problem in Sales. 
        But I don't want to alienate Cynthia either by second guessing her...

        an analysis of the department.  I'd be there to help, not hinder-- which
        would be true.  That would allow me to suss things out and if there's a solution
        that would keep the IPO on track.

        Find out if the delta is real and if it is, come up with a plan.  Can you
