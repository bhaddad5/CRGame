      Text: A pity.  I'd come to rely on Tracey's judgement.  Nevertheless, Planning
        is too important a department to be left rudderless.  I'd like you to take
        the helm there- at least for the time being.  I don't need to ask if you're
        up for it.  For such a young executive, you've certainly proven yourself
        up to this point.
