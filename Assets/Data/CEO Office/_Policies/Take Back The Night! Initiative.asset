  Description: "In response to the increasing violence that female staff are experiencing,
    this policy is an effort to  raise corporate awareness as a preventive measure
    against future sexual assault. The mission of the Take Back The Night! Initiative
    is to end the exploitation and abuse of female corporate colleagues in an effective,
    technology-based approach.\r  You can now begin the implementation of this initiative,
    which will require the distribution of anti-sexual assault wardrobe (specifically
    chastity belts) to all junior female staff.  Initially, the keys to said devices
    should be restricted to yourself and trusted senior male managers.\r\n"
