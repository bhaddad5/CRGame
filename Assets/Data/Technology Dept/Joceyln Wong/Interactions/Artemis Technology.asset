        our IT Manager and she handles the day to day technology needs.  She's fantastic
        and can help you with anything from your personal equipment to questions
        about our campus network.

        Blair Santos-- she's our Research Manager.  She's working on our next generation
        offerings.  As you know, SheSays is our main corporate offering- a suite
        of productivity apps just for women.

      Text: SheSays is really a mature product.  Blair is much more involved in some
        new product ideas centered around artificial intelliegence.  As for meeting
        her, I'm afraid that's difficult.  We keep her isolated because of security
        concerns.  Perhaps when you've achieved a higher security clearance rating,
        we can come back to this.
