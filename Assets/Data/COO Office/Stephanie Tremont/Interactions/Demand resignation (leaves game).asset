      Text: Stephanie, you almost had me!  Using my own secretary against me-- clever
        idea!  Unfortunately, it appears Debbie's hd a change of heart.  She's very
        remorseful too.  Claims you put the whole 'MeToo" thing in her head.  Here's
        her statement.

      Text: Actually it is my word-- and Debbie's word-- against you.  You'll resign
        immediately or this statement will be leaked to the media and your reputation
        as a liar will be etched in stone.  Your choice.  Either way, you're done
        and you'll leave with nothing.
