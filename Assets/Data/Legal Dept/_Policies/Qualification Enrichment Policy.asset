  Description: "As the company\u2019s skills requirements change in the face of business
    and technology disruption, it is suggested that the company take this opportunity
    to re-align qualification requirements for all executive-level roles.  This will
    result in a better recruitment and retention rates for staff.\r\n\r\nThis will
    allow you to commence with the de-qualification of executives that have matriculated
    from universities we wish to de-legitimate, as well as end the recognition of
    female-oriented degrees such as \u2018Women\u2019s Studies.\u2019  Internal re-assignments
    can now begin.\r\n"
