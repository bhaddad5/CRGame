  Description: "Health care costs have increased dramatically and failure to address
    this issue could result in the unthinkable: actually having to drop health care
    as part of the employee benefits package.  In order to avoid this fate and to
    mitigate rising health insurance costs, the company could appointed a new health
    insurer, with provisions to ensure this benefit be available.   All employees
    will be covered fully but must make themselves available for regular exams and
    changes in benefits.\r\n\r\nDoctor-patient privacy considerations will now be
    waived.  Managers will now have access to all staff medical records.  Staff will
    now be assigned doctors selected by their managers and all treatments and procedures
    must be approved by the manager.  Details of all consultations will now be communicated
    to the manager in question.    \r\n\nNOTE: Unlocks Pry Medical Facility\n"
