      Text: I understand Perkins Geary is our corporate law firm.  I was wondering
        if it would be possible to set up a meeting with them.  I was hoping to get
        a crash course on IP and I know you have a very busy schedule

        Geary.

      Text: Look, I know it is a big ask, but in order to do my job properly, I need
        to know what I don't know about IP.  I don't think the paralegal would have
        that kind of legal expertise.

      Text: Valerie?  She's a work horse but no, she's no expert on IP.  I wish she'd
        drop this law school nonsense and be content to stay in her lane.  She's
        not a bad paralegal.  You really want an introduction, do you?

      Text: Well... ok.  I'll make a call to Malcolm.  But be forwarned.  The old
        bastard will try to grind you for offerings.  Unusual gifts.  It is like
        he thinks he's a feudal lord over there at PG and he's due tribute from the
        peasants.  Don't let him push you around!
