      Text: Well Counselor, from now on you'll be relying on your looks to carry
        an arguement and you'll need to look the part.  I'll set up an account for
        you at Vixxxens, which will cater to all your new fashion needs.  That said,
        I'm sure you have enough cash in your bank account to cover the costs of
        your new work uniforms.  I'd say three thousand should cover it.
