        as Women's Studies and the like.  And just executives.  Forget the juniors

        I have a list for you.  It includes Carole Tyson-Fontaine-
        she has a Women''s Study degree.  Susan Granger- she has an education degree. 
        Cynthia Fitzgerald only has an Associates degree, so she technically falls
        under the threshold and... Jennifer Page.  She has an admin skills certificate,
        so the CEO technically isn''t qualified for her current position.'
