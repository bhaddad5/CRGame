      Text: Well, for one thing my boss is hardly ever here.  Since she's so busy
        representign her various causes, I'm the one who has to take up the slack. 
        Don't get me wrong-- I think it is great that Amber gets to go to a lot of
        meetings while I handle the daily grind.  I'm just a paralegal, right?

      Text: Terms of Service-- those boring dumb thing syou have to click "Yes' to
        all the time to keep us clear from any legal liability.  We have loads of
        them.  Between us, I've just started going through the backlog of TOSs that
        are a mess.  Nothing serious so far, thank goodness.  Perkins Heary, our
        law firm, covers off on everything else.  If it weren't for them, we'd be
        in real trouble.
