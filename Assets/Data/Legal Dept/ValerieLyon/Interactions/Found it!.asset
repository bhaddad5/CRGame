      Text: No, no-- EULA-- the end-user license agreement!  It is what we require
        our corporate users to agree to before allowing them to access our applications! 
        It asks for explicit access to private information-- which is TOTALLY illegal! 
        If anyone questioned us on this... we're just lucky no one reads these damn
        things!
