      Text: What can you tell me about our law firm, Perkins Geary?  Is it a female-run
        shop?

      Text: Hardly.  Perkins Geary is about as old school as you can get.  Probably
        the most influential firm in the city, with tentacles to the state house
        and the capital.  It's been around forever.  That's why Jen hired them- they
        have prestige and open doors.  Plus they are have a great rep in the IP area. 
        Sorry-- that's Intellectual Property.  Amber used to work there before she
        came over to Artemis.

      Text: Malcolm Perkins.  The old man himself is our contact.  We're an important
        client.  He knows where the bodies are buried, believe you me!
