      Text: Doctor Quinn!  How nice to see you!  Oh, but the Thesis Committee rejected
        your dissertation, didn't they?  How unfair of the Gender Studies Department
        to treat their star academician and author that way!

        My personal secretary is an MBA.  I'd love to add a PhD to my collection.
