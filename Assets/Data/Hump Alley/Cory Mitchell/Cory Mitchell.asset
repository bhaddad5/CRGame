  Bio: 'Ms. Mitchell was a fast rising public relations expert with a major consumer
    goods multinational.  After a re-organization, she took a substantial severance
    package which she used to launch her own consultancy.  The new communications
    consultancy''s future seemed quite promising until she received a negative review
    of her services in the National Business Index after she had a falling out with
    a key client.  Two years later, she''s now found herself making ends meet by
    working the Alley.    '
