      Text: Having a secretary with an MBA would be most useful.  As for her preferences,
        I'm not concerned with that.  If she had to, she'd buckle down and learn
        to take orders.  But I can't have her quitting.  Which is why I've updated
        her profile on the National Employers Index.  I'm afraid it isn't a very
        positive review of her work.

      Text: As your manager, that's your perogative.  But it would destroy any hopes
        she'd have pursuing a new job.  The NEI Profiles are accessed by every major
        corporation.  A poor review would prevent her from even getting an interview,
        let alone a job offer.

        if that's what you want, I'll do as you ask.  I'll schedule a meeting with
        her profile on my PC and I'll leave the office for an 'emergency'.

        with authority figures.  It suggests she'd be a high risk hire, especially
