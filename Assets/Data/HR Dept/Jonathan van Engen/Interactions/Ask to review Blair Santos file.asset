        Cheap and good is good enough, right?  But that's how you end up hiring a

      Text: Luzon Polytechnic Institute.  You run into this all the time overseas. 
        It's a diploma mill.  Forget a camus-- it is probably a post office box. 
        Blair Santos may be a bright girl but but her degree is a fake through and
        through.
