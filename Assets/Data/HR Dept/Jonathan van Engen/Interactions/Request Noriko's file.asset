      Text: I'm not sure.  She said she worked as a Management Accountant for Tomo
        before Jennifer lured her over here.  It sounds liekea typical Jennifer hire--
        just sort of based on instinct and the moment.  It sounds like it was a verbal
        offer.

        Yes, her employment history doesn't say anything about her being a Managment
        Accountant.  It says she was employed as an Account Manager by Tomo.  Maybe
        it was a translation thing.  Oh, wait...

        then got her Financial Management MBA from there too.  Wow-- she''s a Kappa
        Phi too!  So, she''s no dummy.  Funny that Tomo didn''t put her in a financial
        management role and stuck her in some marketing role instead.  '

        Our CEO was under the impression she was a Management Accountant, not some
        marketing type.

        if she's still in touch with her old Tomo colleagues.  She seems so touchy
        about her old employer though.  Maybe IT might have some ideas about helping
        me learn more about our lovely CFO...
