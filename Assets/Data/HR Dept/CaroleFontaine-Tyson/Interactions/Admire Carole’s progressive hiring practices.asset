      Text: Well, Jada for example.  It is obvious she's not terribly competent and
        she's got a bad attitude.  But you chose her anyway, because you wanted a
        woman of colour in the department.  I'd be so resentful if I were you.

      Text: She is a burden at times.  I suppose it is worth it-- though I wish she'd
        be more appreciative, given her situation.  Perhaps I should insist on more
        gratitude from her...
