      Text: Sabrina Poole?  Why not the top seeded world's female tennis player or
        an Oscar winner?  Really Wayland, could you have selected a less high profile
        personality to be your future companion?

      Text: I never said it was a requirement for the deal-- merely an option for
        you to bring the cost down.  And I have assigned an over the top value to
        this compoent, to be fair.  One hundred revenue for one woman-- you'll never
        be offered a deal like that again!  But it is up to you.

      Text: 'NOTE: He''s right- 100 Revenue is many, many multiples over what a transaction
        like this usually represents.  It is a way for Smith to demonstrate deal
        flexibility.  You don''t need to take on this tricky request-- it won''t
        be easy.  '
