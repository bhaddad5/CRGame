      Text: AGATHA needs a sound to imprint on the subject- the old 'sound of her
        master's voice' which she'll respond to.  Something innocuous that she can
        listen to and subconsciously respond to once AGATHA is implanted.  The more
        and complex, the better.

      Text: Ah!  Well, there's my new audio book!  It's rather dry scientific stuff
        to most but Sabrina's known as one of the few media idiots who actually reads
        the books of the authors she interviews.  Not that she'd ever interview an
        obscure boffin like me.  But I can give you a copy of it if that would help. 
        I narrated it myself!
