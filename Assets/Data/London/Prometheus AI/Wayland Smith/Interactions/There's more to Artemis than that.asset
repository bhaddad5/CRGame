        what if I suggested you''ve made some more  incorrect assumptions.  Artemis

        describe.  That said, our R&D efforts are ambitious.  And we might be farther

      Text: Agreed.  Very well.  I'll show my cards first, because despite what you
        may think, there is NO way Artemis is even close to Prometheus at this point-
        and we're still a decade away from realizing our first goals.  When the big
        AI chase began a few years ago, I was still toiling away at Oxford.  I've
        always looked for contrarian trends and I found one.  Everyone was trying
        to replicate intelligence.
