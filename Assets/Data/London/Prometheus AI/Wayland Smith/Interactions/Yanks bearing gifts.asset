      Text: Those are multiple questions and some bad assumptions, {FirstName}. 
        I'll answer-- but I expected full disclosure from you as well.  I'll start. 
        I wasn't trying to replace you at Cromwell.  Perhaps Zarasa did but that
        was not my intention.  I was only looking for a partner to help support our
        research.  Prometheus requires funding.

        to fund you-- in exchange for equity I assume?  Or a share of future profits? 
        Zarasa's no fool, so I assume you're onto something big.  What will you do
        now?

      Text: I'll go hat in hand looking for investment.  It isn't easy when your
        proposed offering is a decade away.  But now I get to ask you a question.
        What's happened to Zarasa?  We were on the cusp of a deal when she just went
        silent and now seems powerless to make any deal.  There are rumors she's
        nothing more than Schofield's mistress now.  Her behavior has precipitated
        a major scandal in Pakistan.  I assume she broke her Confidentiality promise
        as well.

        And perhaps Miss Sistani needed some... modification.  Perhaps I applied
        a technological solution to a serious business problem.  And perhaps I can
        apply a financial solution to your challenge.  Perhaps Artemis would be interested
        in funding your efforts.  '

        fad regarding carve outs for 'women based' technology, you wouldn't have
        a business.  Your offerings are garbage-- just nicely skinned pink apps. 
        Our two companies have nothing in common, I assure you, and this discussion
        is pointless.  Good day.
