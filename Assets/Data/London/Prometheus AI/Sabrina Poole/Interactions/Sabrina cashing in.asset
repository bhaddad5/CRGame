      Text: The AGATHA conditioning forces compliance but it doesn't address the
        emotional dimension.  I can tell-- she hates me.  It's entirely unconscious--
        she can't explain why-- but she blames me for the very bad decisions she's
        made regarding her career.  How did you manage such a superior outcome with
        Debbie?
