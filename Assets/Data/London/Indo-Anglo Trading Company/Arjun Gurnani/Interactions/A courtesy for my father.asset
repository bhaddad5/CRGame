      Text: Mr. {LastName}, I understand from my father that we owe you gratitude
        for assisting with this visa nonsense.  I'm personally appreciative and Indo-Anglo
        has already secured dozens of business visas-- so thank you.  It's earned
        you an audience with my father and now me.

      Text: Perhaps, although our main focus is not in the tech sector.  We're more
        about transactional consumer categories- ones India is well positioned to
        exploit here in the UK.  And frankly, part of our mission statement is to
        work with Indian entrepreneuers- no insult to Americans.  Hell, I went to
        school there!

        not the poverty stricken hellhole of black and white twentieth century documentaries. 
        We're a proud nuclear power with a bursting leadership and middle class eager
        to expand.  Britain is weak, divided and ripe for exploitation.  It is begging
        for Indian administration.

        My father has sentimental fondness for this country but I don't.  I see it
        simply as a country and people ripe for generating wealth for Indian owners
        and managers.

        banks the gold.  It's something even more valuable.  I think you know what
        I'm speaking of.  I'll ask my cousin to see you but I can't promise anything,
