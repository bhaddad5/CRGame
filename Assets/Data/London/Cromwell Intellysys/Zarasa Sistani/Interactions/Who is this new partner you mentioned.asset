      Text: I understand your conversation about me with Alastair didn't lead you
        to your preferred outcome, as my LSE professor would have put it.  Mr. {LastName},
        if you wish to work this out, you'll need to do it directly with me.  I'm
        not opposed to building on our current relationship, but I need to do what's
        best for Cromwell.

      Text: 'That''s a potential partner-- I''m still evaluating their tech. They
        are far behind Artemis in terms of development BUT their technology quite
        promising.  And the relationships aren''t mutually exclusive-- Cromwell might
        well work with both parties.  And no-- I won''t tell you who they are.  I
        haven''t even told Alastair! '

      Text: When we signed on with you, we were a much smaller operation.  We're
        ten times the size now and I believe the jv agrement needs to be re-written
        to recognize that.  I want more marketing, admin and technical support if
        we're to continue to work together.  Otherwise, we'll be obliged to work
        out a better deal with another partner!
