      Text: The SheSays product was quite promising.  The product seems tired now. 
        Our government clients still are receptive-- they have to be, considering
        the regulatory pressures with regards to female empowerment.  But our corporates
        are less enthusiastic.  They're starting to question their investment in
        Artemis offerings.

      Text: By all means, Ms. Sistani.  First, we've dramatically upgraded our executive
        team, including our CTO.  That's led to an acceleration of R and D efforts
        and we've since made huge progress towards the next generation of Artemis
        products.  We have prototypes in the field now and initial clinical test
        results suggest a quantum leap in terms of results.
