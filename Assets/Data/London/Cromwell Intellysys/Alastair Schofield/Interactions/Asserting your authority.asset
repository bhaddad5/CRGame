        to keep the business humming.  Still, I had a similar situation back in Zenith
        that I dealt with that was somewhat similar-- an dI managed to make it work
        well for me.  There was a certain very headstrong young lady and an attractive
        one too...

      Text: Very much so.  I won't go into the details-- it was a rather drawn out
        and tiresome process-- but the end result was quite satisying and well worth
        the effort.  Deborah Jones is now Debbie, my personal secretary-- or secretart
        as I mostly think of her these days.
