        Though I'd have to deal with that attitude of her first-- which might be
        even more fun actually.

        I attempted to-- well, let''s just say, Zarasa made it clear that our relationship
        would be entirely professional.  And given that she owns a third of Cromwell
        Intellysys, there''s no point in even going there.  She''s very effective--
        but also a bit of a prickly pear as you may have discovered. '

        are, after all, the Managing Director.  You may have appointed her General
        Manager but she's still underneath you, isn't she?

        she paid me the deference I''m due, she''d just laugh, cash out her equity
        and I''d be stuck right back where I was before she joined Cromwell-- which
        is, sadly, nowhere.  I need Zarasa''s mind more than her body- not that such
        a relationship would ever be in the cards for me in any case. '
