      Text: You suggested you'd be able to influence Zarasa to become friendlier
        towards me.  {FirstName}, isn't it time to admit you've been pranking me
        a bit here?  I haven't seen any changes at all in her behaviour-- not that
        I expected any.

      Text: Alastair, we're only just beginning.  And it's YOU who will need to manage
        your General Manager's transformation.  She's been fitted with technology
        that will begin influencing her but it is YOUR voice that she'll be reacting
        to.  Let's start with reorganizing her priorities.  Are you pleased with
        her physical appearance?

        Not too much though!

        have to sacrifice her free time.  Why don't we discuss this with her?  Just
        follow my lead.
