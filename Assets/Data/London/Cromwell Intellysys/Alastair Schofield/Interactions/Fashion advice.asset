      Text: Mr. {LastName}, I'm a proud Muslim woman who dresses in accordance with
        my cultural norms.  In Pakistan, there are limits on how much a woman, especially
        a professional woman who must balance her fashion choices very carefully. 
        I'll wear what I think best-- but thank you for your 'constructive criticism'.

      Text: '{FirstName} is right.  Surely, you can show a bit of flexibility, Zarasa. 
        Why not reconsider your fashion choices?  Surely you''re progressive enough
        to wear more feminine outfits?  I want my General Manager to get the kind
        of attention she deserves and which will impress our clients and partners! 
        Stretch your fashion horizons.  Am I clear, Zarasa?  '
