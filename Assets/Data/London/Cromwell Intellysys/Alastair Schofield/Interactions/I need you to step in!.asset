      Text: Alastair, I'm finding your GM increasingly difficult to work with.  She's
        refused to give me a commitment regarding our Next Gen product lines and
        she's also informed me you're exploring working with another partner?  What
        is going on here?

      Text: Look, when I started Cromwell, all I had was a redundancy from AngloTech
        and an old name.  The name helped a bit-- there are three admirals, 2 naval
        captains, a bishop and an ambassador in the Schofiedl line.  Me?  I was a
        disposable middle manager with a so-so degree from a second rate school. 
        It was Zarasa who really made Cromwell take off.

      Text: '{FirstName}, I understand your frustration-- but really, without Zarasa
        I''m fairly certain Cromwell''s bottom line would be grossly affected.  And
        Cromwell''s profits allow me to enjoy the kind of lifestyle I always expected
        to enjoy, given my upbringing.  I''m finally a success and I don''t wish
        to jeopardize all that now.'
