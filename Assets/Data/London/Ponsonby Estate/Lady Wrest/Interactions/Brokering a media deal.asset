        more of your time than necessary.  It's about my friend--

        point in a bribery arms race in buying up MPs that would just impoverish
        both you and Angus?

      Text: Well, you have a point there.  But HotTake will take off if we let it
        into the UK-- why would we allow our media brands to be wiped out?  Of course
        we're going to fight!

      Text: Why not... cooperate instead?  The Artemis business model is based on
        joint ventures.  What if you were to work with-- and co-own-- a HotTake UK--
        rather than fight against it?

      Text: Ha!  Well, I could see that working-- as long as it was a fifty-fifty
        proposition.  I'll admit, progressive publishing isn't exactly profitable--
        but gossp and entertainment would be a huge bonanza for Juno Media.

        infrastructure and his model of publsihing- it looks like a win-win and a
        money maker for both parties.
