        what about the woman on BBC-- the big star there.  What's her name?  I see

      Text: Sabrina Poole?  I don't think Alice has reached out to her-- I've had
        her concentrating on the more gossip and lifestyle type shows.  Sabrina Poole
        is a serious interviewer.  I'm not sure she'd be interested in the affairs
        of some little tramp like Alice!

      Text: Wouldn't she?  Princess Alice IS a Royal.  And before her recent... relationship
        with you, she was a fairly independent kind of woman with interesting opinions. 
        Perhaps a 'Day in the Life' type story might be revealing in a way one shot
        interviews wouldn't be.  Plus anything Poole does would have big ratings,
        right?
