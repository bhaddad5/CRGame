      Text: Sybil, Mr. {LastName} is to be greeted with courtesy.  He is a welcome
        guest anytime he chooses to drop by.  Surely, you've earned it.  This little
        MI5 agent makes a perfectly suitable servant, don't you think?  She's even
        quite a spirited bedwarmer-- not that Alice approves!

        And you made sure no one could identity you in either so the public just
        thinks I'm a slut now!  My God-- the family is ready to disown me!

      Text: You see, your chemistry kit really is amazing!  She can't get enough! 
        But there is still a pride based on hundreds of years of entitlement that
        needs beating out of her.  Sybill seems quite excited to help with that. 
        You're invited to enjoy the spectacle of a princess being re-educated, Mr.
        {LastName}.

      Text: I do think it will take some time, but it will result in an Alice more
        suitable for the kind of relationship I require with her.  Join us as you
        like-- when she's sufficiently 'educated', we can talk business again.  Alright?
