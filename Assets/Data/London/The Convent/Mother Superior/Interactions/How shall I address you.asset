        in Society hands for almost two hundred years now.  While I adore the Gothic
        atmosphere of the Hellfire, I find a kind of serenity when I'm inside the
        walls of The Convent!

        for them, we have a friendly agreement so we often recycle Hellfire leftovers. 
        And Cassidy was my most recent contribution.  Such a smart girl-- from some
        town in Ohio or someplace-- but she wanted to study the Romantics at Hellsgate! 
        The Polish stewardess is rougher trade but she''s coming along.  '

        images of males, let alone red blooded ones!  I only am showing you these
        two because you know them from Hellfire but even these two will suffer from
        the most fevered dreams after seeing you!  They'll require extra scourging
        all week because of the fantasies they'll weave around you long after you've
        gone.

      Text: They must be purified, Mr. {LastName} of such impure, corrupting thoughts. 
        Here in The Convent, all such thoughts and desires must be bent to the attention
        of other women-- the Big Sisters in the first instance and each other in
        the next.  When Cassidy embraces her Inner Lesbian, she'll make a perfect
        lover-- perhaps even merit promotion to Big Sister in time.
