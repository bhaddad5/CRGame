      Text: So we come to it at last, Mr. {LastName}.  Let's start with a story that
        began about forty-five years ago.  A scholarship bookworm and the heiress
        school captain- two more different girls you can't imagine-- and roommates
        no less!  I won't bore you-- the details of such romances mean nothing unless
        one is involved.  Let us say it lasted, on and off, through our twenties
        when Life took us in different directions.
