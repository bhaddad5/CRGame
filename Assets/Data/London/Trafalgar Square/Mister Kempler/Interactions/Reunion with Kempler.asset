        old man complaints.  Thank you for your package.  Most helpful in dealing
        with a very particular transaction.  It''s good to see you graduating to
        the European market.  You''re planning on expanding in London at last then?  '

      Text: Of course.  You've more than proven your capabilities.  But I do caution
        you.  The Old World embraced our particular trade centuries ago with bloody
        talons-- and has never abandoned it.  Selectacorp is merely the latest entrant--
        but other, older groups have traded in human flesh for much longer.

        Of course, your brashness is a tonic as always.  I'm sure you'll handle it
        all-- just be aware.  This is a decadent and degenerate place.  The West
        is decaying and the underlying animal instincts are revealing themselves. 
        All I'm saying is be careful!

        yes?  An excellent choice by the way-- but then you came to us with superb

        World Energy Congress Executive Committee meeting.  Your little widget proved
        essential in acquiring her.  Not my taste but I'll admit the symbolism is
        exquisite.  The fee was ridiculous for such an unappetizing offering, but
        there you are.
