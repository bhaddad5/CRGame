        finally seen the light!  Your good deed will draw Britain into India's orbit
        even more.  Well done!

      Text: Ah, yes, of course!  Yes, I imagine he will!  And I'd be happy to arrange
        an introduction.  Percy Manor is truly magnificent, as you'll see for yourself. 
        However, his schedule is VERY busy, as you can imagine.  It might be some
        time before he's able to see you!

      Text: Well, perhaps if you brought a gift?  The Baron is a great patron of
        the arts, especially traditional Indian artwork.  If you were to find a suitable
        gift at, say, Harrods?  I understand they have an excellent Personal Shopping
        service, so you wouldn't have to deal with the public at all.  Let me know
        when you've found something and I'll call the Baron myself on your behalf!
