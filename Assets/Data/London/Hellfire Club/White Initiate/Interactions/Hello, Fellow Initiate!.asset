      Text: Hello, there.  I see I'm no longer the new girl on the block!  You're
        American, I understand?  How colonial!  What a blunder to have let you all
        off the leash the way we did!  What fun we might have had if we'd held on
        to America!

      Text: No, they didn't bother with all that with me.  I get a pass on a lot
        of things like that.  They're just happy to have me be a member.  Why aren't
        there any boys though?  It's all girls!  Which is still fun to watch but
        I'm not really into the whole lezzie thing.  We definitely need some boy
        guests!  Isn't that sexism or something?
