        not so long.  It really depends on how bored the members get with them. 
        The ones that put up a fight often last much longer!  Which leads me to your
        membership dues.

      Text: It's club tradition.  I'm the White Knight, assigned as Bailiff.  The
        White Queen is the Castellan and responsible for club quarters.  You'll eventually
        earn a rank and be assigned a club role.  But that's in the future.  To be
        accepted as an Initiate, you must make an offering.  It's fine-- the Black
        Queen and the Black Bishop have made all the arrangements.
