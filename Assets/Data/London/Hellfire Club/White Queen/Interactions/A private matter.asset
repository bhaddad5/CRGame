      Text: I understand that you've addressed our extraneous guest.  It's a difficult
        matter but disposal is a necessary requirement of all members of Hellfire. 
        You may not know it but in successfully handling the disposal, you passed
        a test.  Not all Initiates have met the challenge, which has required from
        time to time resulted in two disposals.

      Text: As you say and well done.  I was hoping we might discuss a personal matter. 
        The White Knight has allowed that your expertise in the area of, shall we
        call it behavioral modification?, is a remarkable thing.  Don't blame poor
        Alastair- he's a weak man, but I suspect you know that already.

        my office?  The Club isn't the place for this kind of discussion and revealing
        my public persona will demonstrate the weight I place on this request.
