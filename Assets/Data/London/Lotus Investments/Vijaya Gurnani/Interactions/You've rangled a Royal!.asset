        woman and get her disowned by her own family.  How that is of value to your
        plans, I have no idea.  All it seems like is that the Prince of Wales is

        more tasks and you'll get the full backing you need for your commercial dreams
        of expansion.  There's a piece of legislation I need sorted.  It's all rather
        obscure, which is why it's been gathering dust in Parliament for years. 
        The Chief Whip should be able to sort it out for you.  You know the Black
        Bishop, do you not?
