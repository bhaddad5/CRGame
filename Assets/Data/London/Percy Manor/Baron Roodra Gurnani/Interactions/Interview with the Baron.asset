        back once I've had it hung.  I'm thinking it would look lovely in the South
        Library-- either that or in the Green Room.  In any case, it was a marvellous
        gesture.

        If so, you  have my gratitude.  There''s a limit to what our Honorary Consul
        can do.  You know, when I was a young man with few prospects, I came to Britain
        to make a living.  I ended up earning a fortune.  And now, other young Indians
        will come here and make even bigger fortunes. '

      Text: It is my family that is remarkable.  I am merely honored to bear it. 
        My great grandfather was the Zamindar of Shankar.  He was a loyal supporter
        of the Raj.  But when Independence was granted, he was abandoned.  The Gurnanis
        sunk into obscurity and eventually poverty.  It forced my move here.  But
        a noble name will not be denied and so here we are.

        on philanthropy and public affairs at this stage in my life.  But, because
        you have proven useful, I shall arrange a meeting with my son Arjun.  He
