        of both our families.  Then, I don't know why, we went into different directions. 
        Academia wasn't as forgiving back then and my father made threats regarding
        my inheritance and... Anyway, that's all in the past.  We're the best of

        interest at this point.  If it was a money thing, I wouldn't need your expertise. 
        But, believe it or not, there are, unfortunately some things money can't
        buy... not directly, anyway.  You're looking for investment capital to back
        growth, perhaps an acquisition, I understand.  Would TWENTY-FIVE REVENUE

        wannabe but what a pretty face!  She got her start here at Juno!  We became
        lovers.  Then she won a damn award and boom!-- she was headhunted away from
        me and the rest of the dreary story proceeded-- she met a young share trader,
        dropped me and that was that.
