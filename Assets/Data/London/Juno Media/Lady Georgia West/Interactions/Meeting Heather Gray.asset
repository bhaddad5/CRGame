      Text: Heather, let me introduce you to Mr. {LastName}.  He's from the States. 
        We're discussing areas we might partner in.  Heather is the Editor of Lilac,
        our lesbian lifestyle magazine.

        really not the best editor for Lilac.  What about me taking on the new Working
        Woman site?  I'm much better--

      Text: Heather, we've gone over this!  I need an experienced editor on Lilac! 
        And no one thinks a woman who's been married for twenty years and has a daughter
        is a lesbian.  She's so independent- it was what I loved in her when she
        was a cub reporter!  Heather, have you seen to your Employee Consultation
        at the Gloucester Practice?

        the end of the discussion.  I'm the Publisher here, Heather- not you.  Now,
        please leave us-- I'm sure you're quite busy.

      Text: And now we're alone.  Whatever you've done is working.  Heather always
        gave me an argument on even the smalllest things.  It may be because she's
        still rather vulnerable as a result of her husband skipping out on her, but
        when I told her she's be working on Lilac and that was that-- she folded. 
        I could sense she wanted to argue, but...  Yes, it's working!

      Text: The most effective shift is gradual, Lady West.  Take your time.  I'll
        be here to guide you but the more care you take with Heather, the more satisfying
        her final turnabout will be.  I don't sense she has any residual feelings
        for you- do you?
