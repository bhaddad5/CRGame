  Description: In order to both maximise our staff potential and align with operational
    needs, the company requires foreign nationals in key positions.  The company,
    however, also reserves the right to re-design the roles these staffers hold!  
    This policy unlocks opportunities to change the status of employees with company
    sponsored visas.
