      Text: Not at all!  Hey, I'm a nice guy!  All I want is a personal secretary
        with big tits!  Is that so much to ask?  No, she's off at Pry getting her
        tits done.  She agreed to the salary sacrifice loan, which should be paid
        off in about five years.

      Text: Exactly!  I get what I want and Maddy gets to keep her job!  She's also
        getting more than she thinks too!  She thinks we've agreed to C cups but
        when the aneasthesia wears off, she'll see what I told the Pry guys to give
        her-- a nice pair of Double Es!
