  Description: "This policy would adjust recruitment and hiring policies to reflect
    a need for both STEM skilled candidates and empowering women in this challenging
    field.  Henceforth all executive roles would require some STEM background and
    priority would be given to women in such roles.\nThis policy may seem contra
    to SelectaCorp objectives,  It is not.  There are only a handful of female STEM
    professionals and by forcing the company to adopt this policy, it will have the
    quite unintended consequence of flooding mission critical roles with male candidates.  
    When a female can\u2019t be found for the role, it MUST be given to the next
    best qualified one, which in all cases will be male.  Artemis will be enjoying
    a much-needed rush of testosterone in the future due to your good work!"
