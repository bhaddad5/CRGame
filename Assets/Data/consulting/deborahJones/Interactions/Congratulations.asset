      Text: I suppose congratulations are in order.  I got the memo.  I'm really
        happy another Management Trainee has risen so quickly.

      Text: You're a liar.  But I accept your congratulations.  And I expect your
        full compliance from this point going forward.

      Text: Well, that's to be determined.  You have to earn loyalty and respect. 
        Just because you're in charge doesn't mean things will change.  I expect
        to complete the Management Trainee Program and move into another department
        soon enough.  Remember, I'm not a permanent CSG staff member.

      Text: Perhaps.  But as long as you are in my department, you'll carry out responsibilities
        ot my satisfaction-- or you will NOT complete the Management Trainee Program
        successfully.  Is that understood Debbie?

      Text: Yes, it is perfectly reasonable.  But you will NOT call me "Debbie'. 
        Is that understood?
