      Text: Well, that's to be determined.  You have to earn loyalty and respect. 
        Just because you're in charge doesn't mean things will change.  I expect
        to complete the Management Trainee Program and move into another department
        soon enough.  Remember, I'm not a permanent CSG staff member.

      Text: Perhaps.  But as long as you are in my department, you'll carry out responsibilities
        ot my satisfaction-- or you will NOT complete the Management Trainee Program
        successfully.  Is that understood Debbie?
