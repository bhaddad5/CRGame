      Text: 'They said they got an update from HR regarding your employment status. 
        Because of your precipituous failure to crack the executive ranks, they are
        concerned about your ability to make payments.  I''ve agreed ot co-sign your
        loan and that seemed to sort it out.  It will just take you a bit longer
        to pay it all off now, that''s all. '
