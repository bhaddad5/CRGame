      Text: Than start impressing me and I'll consider how I can use you.  You might
        start by thinking more about what you wear to work.  I think it is time you

      Text: You can take control of an Artemis girl when her Ambition is zero or
        less.  Once you take control, you get an Ego bump equal to her starting Ambition. 
        Once you take control, the girl will dress to impress you more and new options
        are unlocked.
