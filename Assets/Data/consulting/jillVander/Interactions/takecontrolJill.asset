      Text: You can take control of an Artemis girl when her Ambition is zero or
        less.  Once you take control, you get an Ego bump equal to her starting Ambition. 
        Once you take control, the girl will dress to impress you more and new options
        are unlocked.

        lean on her-- and you WILL lean hard on this overly educated temp drone...
