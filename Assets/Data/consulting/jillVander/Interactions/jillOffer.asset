      Text: Their TPS forms.  They contain all kinds of personal data-- from salary
        to performance metrics to how often they are on company grounds.  It all
        goes automatically to HR.  I can alter them in a way that will set off all
        kinds of red flags.  It would take weeks to sort it out and make them look
        awful until it got sorted.
