        Department, which we\u2019re a subsidiary of.  That gives us some breathing
        space to be honest!  We never anticipated such growth; it just goes to show
        that the Artemis brand is ever stronger than we imagined.  That's why our
        offices are scattered all over the city!"

        my annual housewarming party and we can get to know one another better then!"

        the big towers but, like I said, I'm appreciating having our own space.
