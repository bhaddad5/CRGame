        Jen, that's our CEO, put a lot of trust in me and was well-rewarded.  I've
        worked in, and with, every Department of Artemis since its inception.  In
        fact, I've been so busy with my job that I haven\u2019t had even so much
        time for a social life!  Um, not that Artemis doesn't believe in having a
        balanced work/life program\u2014we totally do and support that!  "

        salary?  There were a few founding members that dared to criticize Jen for

        eating crow now!  Those were defintely lean times, but we bet on our ourselves
        and now it's going to pay off in a big way for all those who trusted and
        kept the faith."
