      Text: 'You''re been taken on as a Management Trainee.  Your day job will consist
        of the usual silliness- writing up meaningless reports and preparing pointless
        paperwork.  You''re smart enough to know how to make it look like you''re
        working-- even while you''re actually focusing on your real assignment! '

        is counting on you to work your way up the ladder, leading to eventual control
        of the whole company.  You''ll do this by employing whatever methods you
        are able and you are certainly allowed to enjoy the growing benefits of your
        upward rise.  '

      Text: For now, you're at the bottom of the corporate heirarchy, just barely
        above the drones in what is considered the joke department of the company. 
        You'll need to expend EGO in order to ingratiate, charm, bully or otherwise
        insert yourself into the lives of the staff around you.

      Text: By exercising your EGO, you can reduce the natural AMBITION of the staff
        you target.  Once you've been able to reduce ther AMBITION to zero, you can
        take CONTROL of an employee.  Further attacks on her PRIDE will eventually
        allow you to unlock even more possibilities.

      Text: If you take some DOWNTIME, you can recoup your EGO by five points per
        half day.  There are other ways to increase your EGO but the best way is
        to take CONTROL of a girl, then BREAKING her.  When you assume CONTROL or
        BREAK a girl, you earn that girl's initial AMBITION in both instances.  The
        more powerful the woman is, the more EGO you'll need to deal with her.
