      Text: Jennifer's little English friend.  She runs International for us.  Smart
        girl, but she's under the gun.  I can understand her need for speed-- Cynthia
        Fitzgerald would like nothing more than to pull International back into the
        Sales organization.  Can you get the JV draft back to her today?
