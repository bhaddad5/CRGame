      Text: While I'm not happy about the circumstances, I am pleased to appoint
        you as Manager of the Consulting Services Group.  Susan's incompetence and
        untrustworthiness is no longer in question and Jennifer is no longer covering
        for her.  Congratulations.

        her.  Whilst she's proven a complete failure at management, perhaps you can
        put her to some use in CSG.
