      Text: While I'm not happy about the circumstances, I am pleased to appoint
        you as Manager of the Consulting Services Group.  Susan's incompetence and
        untrustworthiness is no longer in question and Jennifer is no longer covering
        for her.  Congratulations.

      Text: I hope not.  Poor Susan-- I do hope you'll be able to do something with
        her.  Whilst she's proven a complete failure at management, perhaps you can
        put her to some use in CSG.

      Text: You also can enact POLICIES that have a global effect on corporate operations
        and MISSIONS that can be undertaken that unlock rewards.  POLICIES unlock
        opportunities to tighten your control over the company and employees.  When
        you take control of a Department, make sure to enact the policies that will
        help you expand your control!
