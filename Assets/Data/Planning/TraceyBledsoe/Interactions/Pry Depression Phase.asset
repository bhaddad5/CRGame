      Text: It means she's mentally aware of her probable future.  After all, she
        IS a highly educated, senior level corporate manager.  She intellectually
        is aware that you're responsible for her downfall and may have some fate
        in mind for her which she will not enjoy.  Emotionally, however, she cannot
        accept any of this.  Thus, the Depression Phase.
