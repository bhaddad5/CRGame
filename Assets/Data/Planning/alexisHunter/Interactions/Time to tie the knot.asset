        do better.  If I were you, I'd lock her up.  Wouldn't you love having your
        own adoring little wifey?

      Text: I would, but...  I just don't think she's that into me.  She goes through
        the motions and she's trying hard but...  She's not gay.  I'm happy she's
        with me, but that's only because of you.

      Text: I'd like you to have a happy ending.  Suzie needs a woman to tell her
        what to do.  And as long as I have access to her, I think you'd be e great
        little lezzie husband to her.  Yes, I like this idea.  Ask her to marry you. 
        Tell her it was my idea.
