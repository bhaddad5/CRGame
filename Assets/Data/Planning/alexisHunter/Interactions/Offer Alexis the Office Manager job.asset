      Text: I'd like to offer your the OM role.  Before you say anything, let me
        spell out what the job entails.  It means running admin girls through their
        paces and keeping the pool stocked with fresh pickings.  The 7s, 8s and 9s
        won't last long there.  Managers will take on the prettiest ones.  But there
        will be plenty of 5s and 6s for you to have jump through hoops.
