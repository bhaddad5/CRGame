        from your spreadsheets at last!

      Text: Since you're cool with us just having drinks, I'm fine with it.  It's
        true that I don't get out very much.  Anyway, there are a lot of hot looking
        girls here.

      Text: Breaking in Deborah sounds fun.  OK but we stop after this, ok?  I'd
        say Susan Granger.  She's got a hella body and I get the sense that she could
        be turned my way, if you know what I mean.  I could be wrong but I think
        she's flexible.
