        I can't imagine the accommodations will be very luxurious.  There wouldn't
        be much privacy, would there?

        money to provide for a bearable, if not exactly, comfortable place for an
        admin girl to live in.  I'll leave it with you.  Can you take care of this
        for me?

      Text: I'd be happy to!  No, I think the smaller and more spartan, the better. 
        They're only Admin girls and they're damn lucky to have company housing to
        begin with!  I'll squeeze every penny out of the budget so we can jam in
        as many girls into as small as dorm as possible!

      Text: We'll have some bigger rooms for girls who earn them-- as a reward from
        their managers.  But most of them will have to make do with tiny little box
        rooms they'll have to share.  I can't wait to start designing the whole thing! 
        What a fun project to work on-- thank you!
