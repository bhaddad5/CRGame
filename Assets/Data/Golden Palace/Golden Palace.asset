  Description: Uncle Ho's Golden Palace is a Zenith institution.  It's popular with
    everyone from broke college kids to suburban families who regularly drive in
    to either dine in or pick up their favourite Chinese dishes.  It is also a great
    place to keep your ears open for rumours.  Grab a chair, order from the menu
    and just listen.  You never know what you'll overhear while you're eating the
    best Chinese in Zenith!
