The program is a trial, but applying to become part of it would allow Artemis to be more competitive AND deliver a higher share value and dividend return.&#xA;While the program seems innocuous enough, it will allow a more selective interpretation of current regulations and laws, especially those applying to employee relations.  While there will be no immediate effect, implementing this policy will pave the way for more radical changes in the days to come.
